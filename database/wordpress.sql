The link is usually available via the plugin&#8217;s page on WordPress.org. You can also find a link to the author&#8217;s website by searching for the plugin in the backend of WordPress. Also, most plugins in the directory have a link to give a monetary donation.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PluginDonationLink.png" rel="prettyphoto[37980]"><img class="size-full wp-image-38009" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PluginDonationLink.png?resize=975%2C527" alt="Plugin Donation Link" /></a>Plugin Donation Link\n<p>Another way to thank plugin authors is to rate and review their plugins. Ratings and reviews are <a title="http://wptavern.com/rate-and-review-a-wordpress-plugin-day-set-for-october-17th" href="http://wptavern.com/rate-and-review-a-wordpress-plugin-day-set-for-october-17th">an easy way to send feedback</a> directly to an author.

The event focuses on the business side of the WordPress ecosystem and provides opportunities for business owners to learn from those who are blazing a path towards success. On the evening before PressNomics, I joined several business owners for dinner.</p>\n<p>A half hour into the meal, I listened intently to various conversations taking place around the table. Topics of conversation included: market segments, customer satisfaction, and business partnerships. At this point I realized I was definitely at a business conference.</p>\n<h2>The Family Delivers Opening Remarks</h2>\n<p>Joshua and Sally Strebel along with their kids, appeared on stage and delivered the opening remarks. It&#8217;s as if the family invited every attendee into their home for a family reunion.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PressNomics?src=hash">#PressNomics</a> is getting started! <a href="http://t.co/DqFGdEidK4">pic.twitter.com/DqFGdEidK4</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Brian Krogsgard (@Krogsgard) <a href="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/558295522725752833">January 22, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite several competing businesses, companies, and products under one roof, I witnessed so many small groups of people discussing strategy as if they&#8217;re all friends. I felt a positive energy amongst the crowd and several attendees left the event in high spirits, ready to take their businesses to the next level.</p>\n<h2>Session Highlights</h2>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/30-Medium.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37944]"><img class="size-full wp-image-37973" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/30-Medium.jpg?resize=1024%2C768" alt="A Room Full of Knowledge Seekers" /></a>Name the people in this image\n<p>The room was packed with attendees for every session since PressNomics chose not to record or live stream the event.

The statistics he shared confirm that Envato is a huge player in various markets such as WordPress themes, audio files, and plugins. His slides are not available online, but I archived a few stats using Twitter. &#8220;Note that the earnings are before Envato takes their cut.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the first 30 days, the <a title="http://themeforest.net/item/automotive-car-dealership-business-wordpress-theme/9210971" href="http://themeforest.net/item/automotive-car-dealership-business-wordpress-theme/9210971">Automotive theme</a> on ThemeForest had 300+ sales generating over $15K in sales.</li>\n<li>In less than 10 months, the WPlus theme had over 4K+ sales.</li>\n<li>In 2014, Visual Composer was the best selling plugin on CodeCanyon. The second best product is built on top of it.</li>\n<li>Easy Social Share buttons plugin by Appscreo has over 6K+ sales on CodeCanyon.</li>\n<li>Of the top 50 selling WordPress themes in 2014, 67% are new to the list versus 2013.</li>\n<li>79% of themes describe themselves as responsive, but make up 93% of overall earnings.</li>\n<li>Only 4% of themes in the ThemeForest marketplace have earned less than $1K in their lifetime.</li>\n<li>Envato supports initiatives in the WordPress community.

I agreed with pretty much everything she said on the matter and hope those in attendance took notes. Here are a few highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop using jargon to pitch a product because no one talks like that.</li>\n<li>Describe your product, service, or business in two sentences or less.</li>\n<li>Balance your innovation with something that’s familiar.

It&#8217;s a topic I&#8217;ve stayed away from and don&#8217;t talk about much, but Sullivan&#8217;s presentation was not only entertaining, it was enlightening. He showed a brief history of the Google homepage and described why numerous claims of SEO being dead are false.</p>\n<p>The one thing I took away from his presentation is that SEO will never die, but continue to evolve.

He knows how to tell a story and keep the audience engaged. For this presentation, Lema shared tips and disciplines for getting things done. My favorite tip from his session is to start the day writing a list of three things you need to get done. Getting 2-3 items finished each day builds confidence and provides a historical record of things that are done.</p>\n<p>His stance on putting family first is an important strategy I need to work on. So far, listing three things to accomplish each day is working. I feel better about myself and it&#8217;s helping me figure out when I&#8217;ve had a good day.</p>\n<p>The last session featured Joshua Strebel interviewing Matt Mullenweg on stage, but I&#8217;m going to dissect that session in a separate post.</p>\n<h2>A Lot of Fun</h2>\n<p>Not only are the Strebels great hosts, they donated over $10K of proceeds from the event to the <a title="http://www.curesearch.org/" href="http://www.curesearch.org/">CureSearch</a> for Children&#8217;s Cancer charity. If there&#8217;s a PressNomics 4 and you&#8217;re involved in the economics of WordPress, I highly encourage you to attend.</p>\n<p>My goal was to be a fly on the wall for as many conversations as possible and I feel like I&#8217;ve accomplished that goal. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if several strategic partnerships are announced in the next few months with PressNomics being the birth place of the conversation.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t wait for PressNomics 4, consider attending <a title="http://prestigeconf.com/tickets/" href="http://prestigeconf.com/tickets/">Prestige Las Vegas</a>, NV, February 27-28th.

During the last day, attendees had the opportunity to watch Pagely CEO <a href="http://saint-rebel.com/" target="_blank">Joshua Strebel</a> interview Matt Mullenweg. Although the session wasn&#8217;t recorded, the audience tweeted out the highlights of the interview, and discussion continued on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Strebel pressed Mullenweg on Automattic&#8217;s agenda behind <a href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pressnomics?src=hash">#pressnomics</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/strebel">@strebel</a> refers to Jetpack as a Trojan Horse to <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a>, room goes silent</p>\n<p>&mdash; Yeti Support (@YetiSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/YetiSupport/status/558772539032219648">January 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>This resulted in one of the most controversial statements to come out of the event:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>“In the absence of <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@Jetpack</a>, I believe <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash">#WordPress</a> would be declining.” &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pressnomics?src=hash">#pressnomics</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Antony McGregor Dey (@antonymd) <a href="https://twitter.com/antonymd/status/558772451199299584">January 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mullenweg further clarified his statement on Twitter, essentially identifying Jetpack as a tool to bolster the platform against competition. Jetpack allows users to gain access to professionally-supported third party integrations without WordPress being forced to dump all of these features into the core software.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/zedejose">@zedejose</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mkalina">@mkalina</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@jetpack</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/antonymd">@antonymd</a> Naked WordPress (without plugins) is not competitive to Wix, Weebly, Squarespace, etc.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/559559918898794496">January 26, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mkalina">@mkalina</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@jetpack</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/antonymd">@antonymd</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zedejose">@zedejose</a> You should consider the rest: There''s secular decline of non-mobile, non-social publishing systems.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/559532172596359168">January 26, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jetpack-enabled blogs have more features available to them on the WordPress mobile apps, which are wholly sponsored by Automattic. Many self-hosted WordPress users don&#8217;t appreciate the fact that the mobile apps are packed full of WordPress.com features, but, at the moment, there are no superior alternatives. In our most recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">interview with Mullenweg</a>, he deftly addressed the friction caused by <a href="http://wptavern.com/poll-who-uses-reader-in-the-wordpress-mobile-apps" target="_blank">the preeminence of WordPress.com’s Reader in the app</a>, which he sees as a gateway that simplifies the onboarding process for new users.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I see it as a gateway drug and it gives people more options down the road. If we don’t do anything on mobile, five years from now, when everyone is only using mobile devices, they will all have Squarespace’s or Weebly’s. WordPress is still around but it just doesn&#8217;t matter. This allows us to matter five years from now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With both Jetpack and the mobile apps, Mullenweg sees an opportunity for Automattic to provide functionality that goes beyond the core publishing experience to offer mobile access and connect users with readers and commenters via social networks.</p>\n<h3>The Road to 50% Market Share</h3>\n<p>In a recent <a href="http://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e048-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/" target="_blank">interview with Adam Silver on the KitchensinkWP podcast</a>, Mullenweg gave a better overall picture of his next goal for WordPress and how he sees the platform reaching more users in the future. The software is currently used on <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">23.3% of websites worldwide</a> and is on track to reaching 25% before the end of the year. Mullenweg hopes to grow that number to 50%:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The next goal is the majority of websites. We want to get to 50%+ and there&#8217;s a lot of work between now and then. As the percentage increases, it gets harder and harder to grow the market share, and we have to grow the market share by doing things we haven&#8217;t done in the past &#8211; really thinking about the onboarding process, really thinking about the integration with social networks, and with how WordPress works on touch devices, which is going to be the predominant computing platform of the future. These things are going to be really important.</p>\n<p>What got us here isn&#8217;t going to get us there. Once we get to 50%, we can decide something new we want to do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With a focus on the onboarding process, integration with social networks, and mobile publishing, Mullenweg is outlining how he sees the mobile apps and Jetpack entering the picture to grow the market share and prevent the decline of the platform.</p>\n<p>For Mullenweg, a 50% market share with a growing international user base isn&#8217;t a purely business goal, but rather ties back in with WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing with open source software. In response to Silver&#8217;s question on whether or not the recent focus on the mission is connected to an increase in non-English downloads, Mullenweg replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The big assumption in what we&#8217;re doing is that there&#8217;s an inherent goodness to the transparency and the ability for people to publish. Of course people use WordPress to publish things I personally disagree with or might find morally odious. But it&#8217;s very important that we provide the people the opportunity to have that voice. </p>\n<p>By giving everyone equal ability and access to reach the web, you&#8217;re a click away from several billion people. But you&#8217;re not if you don&#8217;t have the tools to really reach them. It&#8217;s not hunger or clean water or any of the big problems that society has, climate change, but at least for our little part in it, I think we can make a pretty big dent in it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg knew that WordPress had the potential to have an enormous impact on the world of publishing, even when the software was still batting in the minor leagues. WordPress.com was originally created to help users set up blogs while bypassing what used to be a complicated hosting and installation process. Over the years, as WordPress.com adapted more sophisticated ways of supporting the average WordPress user, the idea of Jetpack was born to connect self-hosted blogs with the same features.</p>\n<p>The question is whether or not Jetpack and the mobile apps are the missing link for helping users get connected to billions of people. While Jetpack&#8217;s features aren&#8217;t necessarily unique, they are professionally-supported and users feel safe banking on the plugin for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s controversial statement about WordPress being in decline without Jetpack was phrased as conjecture, because there&#8217;s no objective way to prove this unless you remove Jetpack from the picture entirely. As he further explained in his Twitter reply, the notion is based on witnessing the decline of other publishing systems that aren&#8217;t innovating with social or mobile features.</p>\n<p>Those who disagree with the statement object to the idea of hinging the success of WordPress&#8217; market share on a plugin produced by a commercial entity. This is especially provocative when it comes to mobile, as Automattic&#8217;s agenda to promote WordPress.com features goes unrivaled. Nevertheless, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t have a mobile publishing platform without the company&#8217;s subsidy of the open source apps.</p>\n<p>If WordPress is dependent on Jetpack to continue building its market share to 50%, then the software&#8217;s future is inextricably tied to Automattic&#8217;s continued success. The company is one of a small few that have the capital to invest in a major plugin like Jetpack along with the ongoing improvement of the mobile apps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year, Automattic raised a bit more funding than we have in the past,&#8221; Mullenweg told Silver in his interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually bigger than most IPO&#8217;s. We raised $160 million and that gives us a lot of capital to invest into the community. We&#8217;re able to make bigger bets, longer term bets, and it also solidifies us as an independent entity for many years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress open source project can still be considered a success in terms of its mission, even if it doesn&#8217;t achieve a dominant market share. Tying its growth to Jetpack is a bold statement that eclipses some of WordPress&#8217; best qualities, such as its rigid adherence to protecting user freedoms with the GPL, the strong community of contributors, and the massive ecosystem of products and services surrounding it. The availability of Jetpack may be one factor responsible for WordPress&#8217; growing market share, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the sole tool saving WordPress from decline.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:27:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Post Status: WooCommerce is going after photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"https://poststatus.com/?p=7728";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-photography/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7576:"<p>Photography is a huge &#8212; and quite competitive &#8212; market. WooThemes has one nice advantage, in that they are quite dominant in the eCommerce space.</p>\n<p>However, catering to actually selling photos is a whole new world. You&#8217;re talking about competing with dozens of services, some quite vertically integrated (from website, to photo management, to photo fulfillment), to a very picky audience full of people with unique workflows.</p>\n<p>I am not a photographer. However, last year I did a ton of research on photography product potential in the WordPress space. I was working with <a href="http://ran.ge">Range</a>, and we were exploring creating our own photography product. I interviewed a dozen professional photographers in person, ranging in industry, experience, and company size.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot during that research phase; and one thing I learned is that this is no easy venture.</p>\n<p>The new WooCommerce photography extension does one thing quite nicely: it allows a photographer to create albums where customers can bulk purchase photos, and it allows the photographer to upload the photos for purchase, as well as protect the albums so that only the photography client can view them.</p>\n<p>You can view a marketing video, walkthrough video, and screenshots for <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-photography/">WooThemes&#8217; Photography extension</a> on the dedicated product page.</p>\n<h3>Considerations for true professional photo management / sales</h3>\n<p>However, that is one piece of the puzzle. This plugin makes the client-side of ordering relatively painless, but there are other elements to think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrowing an album from a lot of photos to fewer photos</li>\n<li>Choosing to make an album visible to a wedding party or others that may want to purchase, in addition to a client</li>\n<li>Creating a more visual gallery of an album, versus a &#8220;purchase&#8221; view</li>\n<li>Enabling uploads to be synchronous with an editing tool, like Lightroom</li>\n<li>Enabling categorization, automated meta data, and various grouping mechanisms for photos</li>\n<li>The ability to quickly send the same or select photos from a client-viewed album to a new gallery for a blog post about a client event</li>\n<li>Integrating a photo fulfillment service, to actually print and deliver purchased photos</li>\n<li>And much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure WooThemes has done a good bit of research for this product. However, I think they&#8217;ve made a feature that&#8217;s not yet ready for your every day photographer. Of the photographers I met, most lamented the experience of creating, managing, and selling photos and albums.</p>\n<p>I think that there is a lot of room in the self-hosted photography space, and my reasoning is simple. Right now, selling photos and managing albums, client review, etc., on hosted services is super expensive. Plenty of services charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year, and/or charge massive per-purchase fees (like 10%+).</p>\n<p>A self-hosted, WordPress-integrated photography management solution &#8212; built for WordPress professionals &#8212; could be a million dollar idea on its own. I think WooCommerce creating this add-on is an interesting start, but I believe the concept has major legs that could grow into something huge.</p>\n<h3>Here are some other players in the market</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start within the WordPress space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.photocrati.com/photography-wordpress-themes/">Photocrati</a> &#8212; a theme plus eCommerce, gallery, and other features (these are the folks behind NextGen)</li>\n<li><a href="https://graphpaperpress.com/plugins/sell-media/">Sell Media</a> &#8212; Graph Paper Press&#8217;s spin on selling media and prints. If I recall correctly, this is a fork of EDD customized for their photo-heavy theme collection</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.prophoto.com/explore-features/">ProPhoto</a> &#8212; hideous but one of the more &#8220;full service&#8221; photography website options, minus selling</li>\n<li><a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a> &#8212; Out of the box, EDD could be used for selling photos</li>\n<li><a href="https://ithemes.com/exchange/">Exchange</a> &#8212; Out of the box, Exchange could be used for selling photos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No WordPress product is really providing a full solution though. Plenty of non-WordPress products are trying. Here are some that are interseting to look into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.smugmug.com/pro">SmugMug</a> &#8212; A compelling, hosted option. Probably the most interesting in the market.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.instaproofs.com/home/how-it-works.html">InstaProofs</a> &#8212; A widely used method for proofing, selling, and fulfilling photo orders. (Requires 8%-15% commissions!)</li>\n<li><a href="https://discover.pictage.com/features">Pictage</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.shootq.com/">ShootQ</a> &#8212; The most vertically integrated options: from initial lead to photo fulfillment. These two are quite popular, but are expensive SaaS products.</li>\n<li>There are loads of these, but these are popular ones, and give you an idea of what WordPress-oriented products are up against.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>I don&#8217;t envy professional photographers on the web</h3>\n<p>Professional photographers have a lot to juggle.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve got to manage leads, their website copy, their contacts and CRM, their galleries and portfolio, their client albums and workflow, their events, their raw copies of photos and backups, the ability for clients to buy from them, and more.</p>\n<p>Managing this entire setup online is possible, but right now a photographer with a WordPress website and a third party system for album reviews, sales, and leads is kind of lame.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">I think WordPress can do a better job, and reduce expenses for professional photographers, while enabling them to have a more synchronized web experience for their clients.</span> I think WooCommerce introducing a Photography extension is one piece of the puzzle, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the over-arching problem.</p>\n<p>I truly believe someone could create a theme and plugin shop that competes with these third parties. But it needs to have a lot going for it: beautiful display, an easy to use interface (I&#8217;m not sure the back-end of WordPress counts as this), help photographers not continuously repeat themselves during photo management, and generally make their life as a professional photographer easier.</p>\n<p>Hosted services are tackling this problem. Those photographers managing their websites on WordPress may have more freedom and lower costs, but right now the experience isn&#8217;t easier.</p>\n<p>WooThemes is making a good first step. I&#8217;m not sure that they are the right team to really go 100% though. I&#8217;d be interested to see another company build something integrated into this product from WooThemes (or another WordPress eCommerce product) and really solve professional photographers&#8217; workflow grievances.</p>\n<p>Like I said, I interviewed about a dozen photographers from different backgrounds. None of those interviewed felt particularly satisfied with their web workflows. There is room in this market. My question is: who will fulfill their needs?</p>\n<p>I think it can be a self-hosted product or hosted product, or both.

You never know what you will encounter when you venture into the comments section on <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-comments-still-matter" target="_blank">blogs with open discussion enabled</a>, but that&#8217;s the beauty of free expression.</p>\n<p>The Tavern has always been a place where anyone is welcome to offer opinions in the comments, even they&#8217;re not fully polished. Oftentimes this results in some quality interaction from community leaders. We use Jetpack comments, but the module is lacking in features that add a more interactive discussion experience between commenters.</p>\n<p><a href="http://defla.me/" target="_blank">Deflame</a> is a new web app, created by <a href="https://github.com/alexbecker" target="_blank">Alex Becker</a>, that aims to improve the quality of discourse on the internet. Both the standalone app and the Chrome extension were built to work with WordPress sites, since the platform currently dominates the web. Deflame offers three features that allow users to &#8220;ignore asshats,&#8221; delineate a side in debate, and share their perceptions of an argument with others via a unique URL.</p>\n<p>I tested the standalone version and the Chrome extension, using a recent WP Tavern <a href="http://wptavern.com/heropress-launches-kickstarter-campaign-to-highlight-wordpress-developers" target="_blank">post regarding HeroPress</a>, which sparked some heated debate. The app adds radio buttons to identify comment authors with whom you agree or disagree. You also have the option to ignore comments.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflama-example.png" rel="prettyphoto[37875]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflama-example.png?resize=1025%2C1017" alt="deflama-example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37889" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear why sometimes the comments receive two radio buttons, but it&#8217;s likely that the app cannot accurately anticipate the correct placement of the buttons due to differences in comment templates. Once you mark your opinions in the comments, clicking the Chrome extension button will present a summarized table at the top of the page. It includes a unique URL that allows you to share your view of the debate with the flames dampened.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflame-summary.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37875]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflame-summary.jpg?resize=755%2C235" alt="deflame-summary" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37910" /></a></p>\n<p>Becker hopes that the app will give users a way to frame their positions and perceptions on debates that happen in the comments. &#8220;Too often, debates over important issues devolve into reasonable people on both sides attacking the trolls or madmen they perceive as representing the opposition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Deflame aims to give commenters on WordPress-powered blogs the ability to rise above this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the app doesn&#8217;t actually affect the website on which it&#8217;s being used, it offers an independent way of presenting a user-moderated discussion. Users can show an overview of their opinions, even when a site doesn&#8217;t offer interactive voting features for comments.</p>\n<p>However, some may not be comfortable with the fact that the app&#8217;s share link hides comments that have been ignored. The ability to view all comments is the only way to get the proper context for other comments posted in a debate. If visitors arrive to a site by clicking on a Deflame-generated link, they may not understand that they are only viewing a select group of comments. For this reason, I think an additional button to &#8220;show hidden comments&#8221; would be useful.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href="http://defla.me/" target="_blank">Deflame</a> is an interesting idea that might make a useful WordPress plugin, if its code licensing permits. The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/alexbecker/deflame" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It includes a small <a href="https://github.com/alexbecker/deflame/blob/master/supported.md" target="_blank">list of supported sites</a>, though the extension works reliably on many more that are not included in the list. If you want to test it, check out the <a href="http://defla.me/webapp.html" target="_blank">standalone  Deflame app</a> or install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deflame/bfaljebllekeebnpajhkoambfhflhjfk" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 20:41:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"WPTavern: WP Chat Hosts AMA with Justin Tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37863";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://wptavern.com/wp-chat-hosts-ama-with-justin-tadlock";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3905:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jt.jpeg" rel="prettyphoto[37863]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/jt.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" alt="jt" class="alignright size-full wp-image-12052" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Chat is currently hosting an AMA (&#8220;Ask Me Anything&#8221;) session with Justin Tadlock, founder of <a href="http://themehybrid.com/" target="_blank">Theme Hybrid</a> and co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222/" target="_blank">Professional WordPress Plugin Development</a>.

If you&#8217;re new to the format, Fiegel recommends that you check out<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1jg781/i_am_matt_mullenweg_cofounder_of_wordpress_18_of/" target="_blank"> Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s AMA</a>, which was hosted on Reddit a year ago.

As a long-time theme and plugin developer, Tadlock has witnessed WordPress trends over the years and has helped to shape theme development best practices. So far, a couple of the highlights from the AMA include:</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Advice for someone working full-time in an unrelated field trying to break into the WP business? I&#8217;ve been waking up at 5am for years to learn and practice WP dev but it sure seems slow going with the full-time job necessary to feed my family.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Start a WordPress-related blog. Write tutorials. Share things that you learn. Learn things by writing about them. That&#8217;s how I got to know people in the community. It&#8217;s also how I was able to successfully launch Theme Hybrid.</p>\n<p>And, always reply to comments on your blog. You&#8217;ve got to interact with your readers. At a certain point, that gets tough, but keep the conversation going.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the worst thing about WordPress (the software) in your opinion? How can it be made better?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>From a pure user perspective, I&#8217;d like to see the admin simplified even more. Get rid of anything that&#8217;s not necessary. I&#8217;d drop the theme/plugin editors and tools screen for starters. Then, I&#8217;d work on figuring out how to simplify the post screen as much as possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ever curious about the future of post formats, I asked Tadlock if he likes them and if he believes they have a future. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I love post formats. They&#8217;ve really been around for as long as I&#8217;ve been using WP (anyone remember <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/asides/" target="_blank">Matt&#8217;s asides</a>?). I think the initial build was put in too soon, so it&#8217;s created some problems for theme authors. I feel like I&#8217;ve overcome most of those issues with the post formats-related code in Hybrid Core.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a new or experienced theme developer, this is your chance to <a href="https://wpchat.com/t/i-am-justin-tadlock-ask-me-anything/600" target="_blank">ask Tadlock anything</a>.

Although most contributors aren&#8217;t in it for the recognition, it&#8217;s nice for project leaders to have a way to showcase who is behind the work. The relative number of contributors on a project is often a good indicator of how many people are ultimately committed to its success.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/acknowledge-me/" target="_blank">Acknowledge Me</a> is a new plugin created by the folks behind the <a href="http://pods.io/" target="_blank">Pods Framework</a>. It makes it easy to output contributors for any GitHub repository onto a WordPress post, page, or PHP template.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s shortcode is configurable, so you can set the owner (the user name or organization name for the repo), the repo name, and optionally add a header and limit the number of contributors to display.</p>\n<p><code>[acknowledge_me owner="pods-framework" repo="pods" header_text="Pods Is Brought To You By:" total="50"]</code></p>\n<p>The output will generally look the same, no matter what theme you have activated. However, you may need to tweak some of the CSS in the event that the yellow mousover overlay doesn&#8217;t line up.

The <a href="https://pressable.com/about/" target="_blank">Pressable team</a> is currently working around the clock to resolve the issues causing customer websites to go down. The status blog states: &#8220;We do not currently have and will not likely provide an ETA in this situation. The best thing to do is to keep checking the current status at the bottom of this post.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The current outage comes on the heels of <a href="http://pressable.com/blog/2015/01/12/sorry-downtime/" target="_blank">last week&#8217;s outage</a>, for which CEO Vid Luther apologized on the company&#8217;s blog. Some customers reported 24+ hours of downtime. Pressable has been flooded with help desk requests, <a href="https://twitter.com/962nadia/status/558374329683935234" target="_blank">angry</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DetailMyLife/status/558017979607420928" target="_blank">tweets</a>, and emails. For the past two weeks the company has been <a href="https://twitter.com/montidesign/status/558256236341501952" target="_blank">hemorrhaging</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AlanPerlman/status/557946518809088000" target="_blank">customers</a> faster than it can repair the servers.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Happening at Pressable?</h3>\n<p>Recent communications on the Pressable blog have left customers confused about the root of the incidents. The status <a href="http://status.pressable.com/2015/01/21/current-outage-breakdown-and-full-information/" target="_blank">post</a> cites a litany of compounding problems, i.e. issues with caching servers, internal bandwidth limitations on database servers, limitations on the rates at which servers can be added, an isolated cluster that was causing trouble for the others, etc.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Vid Luther to get a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes at Pressable. From the outside, it appears that the company has a lack of infrastructure to accommodate the current customer load, but Luther said it&#8217;s much more than that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The answer to this is complicated, it depends on your understanding of technology, business, and the WordPress eco-system. We are not lacking in terms of hardware or network capacity; we are short on the number of employees we have in comparison to the number of customers we have. Our entire team consists of 5 people, most people are usually amazed to learn about what we&#8217;ve accomplished as such a small team. But, when you have such a disparity in terms of employee to customer ratio, communication in a time of crisis like this suffers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the past several weeks, the company has had all hands on deck to fix the problems, but customers have commented on the lack of transparency and Luther&#8217;s silence during the incidents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to apologize for not having a better communication strategy. Hopefully, others can learn from this, and plan for it accordingly,&#8221; Luther told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But, having a great communication plan doesn&#8217;t work for very long, eventually, you have to fix the problem for good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is what we&#8217;ve been working on. Over the past 12 months, we&#8217;ve had issues, and we&#8217;re tired of apologizing. I thought it would be best for us to deliver the solution instead of saying sorry once again.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>A Long-Standing Problem with Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>Customers have pointed out that while their websites have gone down, the Pressable site remains in tact. &#8220;This is because our website along with several thousand others, are already in our new infrastructure,&#8221; Luther explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new infrastructure has much better underpinnings, not just from a raw horse power perspective, but it&#8217;s been designed with situations like this in mind. I would say it&#8217;s probably one of the more advanced configurations out in the WordPress hosting market.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Luther&#8217;s <a href="http://pressable.com/blog/2015/01/12/sorry-downtime/" target="_blank">post</a> to the company blog regarding the previous outage, he mentions that the company anticipated this kind of problem last summer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fortunately, this is something that wasn’t completely unanticipated, we had identified this as a potential issue last summer, and had been working on upgrading our systems over the next two months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What happened to halt the migration to the new infrastructure? Luther attributes it to an error in judgment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The current situation is one of several scenarios we identified last summer, and then we ranked them in order of impact to customers, and probability of it actually happening. But, as you know Murphy&#8217;s law applies to all situations and people, and it applies here. We anticipated an event like this, and we designed a solution to address it, we were so busy building the new solution, we didn&#8217;t think about putting some safe guards on the old infrastructure.  This was an error in judgement. I am to blame for it.</p>\n<p>The root of the issue here is that our old infrastructure had a very large impact radius, and we didn&#8217;t migrate people fast enough after we had identified it. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Luther recognizes that the recent outages have had an impact on the business, as many customers are looking for alternative hosting solutions. He said that the team has ideas to help mitigate the losses once the situation is stable, but they aren&#8217;t ready to share those at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First we want to make the current system stable again, then we&#8217;ll work with the affected customers and do what&#8217;s right by them,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The five-person Pressable team is currently stretched thin and working overtime. Luther encourages customers to remember that there are human beings working tirelessly behind the servers and technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re exhausted, we&#8217;ve got pregnant wives, parents who&#8217;ve suffered multiple strokes, and some of us are still reeling from a divorce, we&#8217;re human, we&#8217;re juggling too many things at once, and we know we shouldn&#8217;t be, but we don&#8217;t know how to just stop.  The tweets, the comments, and general treatment by customers and competitors has been a brutal reminder of what it is to be a human. Could we have done things diferently? Absolutely.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The hosting business and the technology and infrastructure behind it are complex. Last year, WP Engine, a much larger company that received $15 million in funding in 2014, had to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-addresses-critics-following-damaging-expose-of-its-customer-support" target="_blank">address critics following a damaging exposé of its customer support</a>. Eventually, every successful host will encounter the challenge of keeping pace with its own growth. Engineering customer happiness following unreliable service is an equally challenging endeavor.</p>\n<p>Pressable is cooking up strategies for regaining consumer confidence following the recent incidents, but the first order of business is to resolve the issues surrounding the current outage. This morning the company <a href="https://twitter.com/pressable/status/558660979517431808" target="_blank">opened up a room on its Hipchat account</a> to add another line of communication. For now, customers have no choice but to ride out the storm and watch the <a href="http://status.pressable.com/2015/01/21/current-outage-breakdown-and-full-information/" target="_blank">Pressable Status blog</a> for updates.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 20:02:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: New French Theme Shop Hexagone Launches with Free and Commercial WordPress Themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37748";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:101:"http://wptavern.com/new-french-theme-shop-hexagone-launches-with-free-and-commercial-wordpress-themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3087:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hexagone-themes.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37748]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hexagone-themes.jpg?resize=1025%2C309" alt="hexagone-themes" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37761" /></a></p>\n<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://wptheming.com/" target="_blank">WP Theming</a>&#8216;s Devin Price <a href="http://wptheming.com/2015/01/announcing-hexagone/" target="_blank">announced</a> a partnership with French translation specialist <a href="https://twitter.com/fxbenard" target="_blank">Fx Benard</a> on a new theme shop aimed at the French-speaking WordPress community. <a href="https://hexagone.io/" target="_blank">Hexagone</a> is now open for business with four <a href="https://hexagone.io/boutique/" target="_blank">products</a> available &#8211; two commercial themes and two free themes.</p>\n<p>The duo plan to expand to offer more &#8220;products, support, content, and documentation in the language of Molière.&#8221; Price joined forces with Bernard after successfully working with him on translation workflows and French translations for DevPress themes. The shop&#8217;s name is derived from &#8220;l’Hexagone,&#8221; which is often used to describe France&#8217;s geographical shape.</p>\n<p>Price and Bernard are aiming to make Hexagone the leading source for WordPress themes and tutorials in French. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t too many companies in this space yet, and we’re hoping a great company that’s devoted to the ideals of open-source can do well,&#8221; he said. <strong>&#8220;There&#8217;s 75 million native speakers of French and about 338 million total.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>While the vast majority of theme shops conduct business and support in English, the number of non-English speaking WordPress users is on the rise. Hexagone&#8217;s founders believe that the market is ripe for a theme shop that can provide French language-specific products, documentation, articles, and support. &#8220;If it takes off, we’d love to hire some writers and developers to work with us full-time,&#8221; Price said.</p>\n<p>Hexagone <a href="http://wptheming.com/2015/01/selling-products-with-wordpress/" target="_blank">published</a> a detailed writeup of the technologies used to build the online storefront. The site is powered by Easy Digital Downloads, Stripe, Gravity Forms, and their <a href="https://hexagone.io/boutique/reunion/" target="_blank">Reunion</a> theme. The article offers insight on the different types of plugins and technologies useful for selling digital products with WordPress.</p>\n<p>If Hexagone is successful, it will demonstrate that there is room in the wide world of WordPress themes for more language-niche theme shops. WordPress&#8217; continued international success depends on the ability for non-English speakers to be able to find documentation and support in their own native languages. <a href="https://hexagone.io/" target="_blank">Hexagone</a> is setting out to prove that the French market is ready for it.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 21:49:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Scaling PAPER for Kim";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44619";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2015/01/scaling-paper-for-kim/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:615:"<p>I always like reading <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/">Paul Ford&#8217;s writing</a>, and this one about <a href="https://medium.com/message/how-paper-magazines-web-engineers-scaled-kim-kardashians-back-end-sfw-6367f8d37688">How PAPER Magazine’s web engineers scaled Kim Kardashian’s back-end (SFW)</a> is funny and accessible.

Its mission is to &#8220;develop the WordPress heroes of the world by sharing the accumulated wisdom of the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While looking for a way to give back to the WordPress community, DeRosia spoke with hundreds of people, many of whom live in different time zones around the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I began to notice a common problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many of them felt disconnected from the greater WordPress community &#8211; the Western WordPress community. For some it was a language issue, for others location, and still others simply not understanding culture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The initiative&#8217;s $60K AUD (~$48,000 USD) Kickstarter goal is intended to fund video production, branding, and marketing for DeRosia and his team to film six episodes, spotlighting WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These presentations will share the wisdom these WordPress Heroes have acquired through their successes and failures with one goal in mind: to provide information, insight, and inspiration to WordPress developers all around the world that will help them become WordPress Heroes,&#8221; DeRosia writes in the campaign description.</p>\n<p>Turning developers into &#8220;WordPress heroes&#8221; is a rather nebulous goal that may not easily catch on with the general community. However, the fact that international WordPress developers feel disconnected is a real issue that could use more attention.</p>\n<p>Many WordPress professionals who would like to attend some of the larger community events are denied visas or unable to afford the expense. Cultural misunderstandings across borders are quite common in the community, which is growing fastest in the non-English speaking world.</p>\n<p>This initiative recognizes a real problem, but the marketing and approach could use some additional refining. HeroPress has already received sharp criticism from one of WordPress&#8217; lead developers for its male-only speaker lineup and use of the term &#8220;hero:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins">@pippinsplugins</a> unambiguous hero worship in an open source community (and of six males) doesn''t seem like much of an achievement.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrew Nacin (@nacin) <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/558347928977145856">January 22, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia has a passion for mentoring people and hopes to encourage developers around the world by highlighting their work and expertise.

Sucuri is classifying the vulnerabilities as high risk, with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD:_Risk_assessment_model" target="_blank">DREAD</a> score of 9/10, and recommends that users update their copies of the themes as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The privilege escalation vulnerability is present in both themes, where a WordPress AJAX hook is used to modify a set of options. &#8220;Because all wp_ajax_ hooks are usable by any logged-in users (no matter what privileges they have on the target site), a subscribed user could use this hook to overwrite any options located on WordPress options database table,&#8221; Sucuri explained in the <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/01/security-advisory-vulnerabilities-in-pagelinesplatform-theme-for-wordpress.html" target="_blank">advisory</a>.</p>\n<p>This makes it possible for an attacker to grant all new users the administrator role. However, a user&#8217;s site must be open for registration in order for this kind of attack to be successful.</p>\n<p>The free versions of these themes have been downloaded from WordPress.org more than half a million times apiece, so there are likely to be thousands of WordPress users who could potentially be affected. Fortunately, a patch is already available. The WordPress Theme Review team worked quickly to fast-track the two patched versions of the themes, so anyone who has them installed will see an update notice in the WordPress admin. Users who purchased the commercial versions will also see an update available.</p>\n<p>If you are currently unable or unwilling to update, a plugin is available that will block exploits for the legacy themes. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/Pross/769de6e9219705041c67">download it from GitHub</a> and install it like any other plugin if you need a quick fix to buy you time to update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, this is ONLY in legacy version of these two PageLines products (Framework and Platform),&#8221; PageLines founder Andrew Powers commented on the advisory. &#8220;Since this was first reported to us three days ago, we&#8217;ve immediately patched those files and updated them on WordPress.org, GitHub and anywhere on PageLines servers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far, Powers has no knowledge of the issue having been exploited. The fact that the danger is limited to sites with open registration should also cut down on the number of vulnerable sites. Now that the security issue is public, it&#8217;s imperative that users update immediately.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 19:07:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Matt: New Simplenote";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44613";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://ma.tt/2015/01/new-simplenote/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:425:"<p><a href="http://simplenote.com/2015/01/21/new-simplenote-app-updates-for-ios-android-and-mac/">New Simplenote App Updates for iOS, Android, and Mac</a>, some nice iterations. <ins datetime="2015-01-22T18:30:50+00:00">Update: Simplenote for Android was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/22/7871293/best-material-design-android-apps">just highlighted by The Verge as one of the best Material design apps</a>.</ins></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 00:27:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WPTavern: Drew Jaynes to Lead WordPress 4.2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37669";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2490:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/drew-jaynes.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37669]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/drew-jaynes.jpg?resize=256%2C256" alt="photo credit: 10up" class="size-full wp-image-37692" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://10up.com/about/#employee-drew-jaynes">10up</a>\n<p>WordPress 4.2 development officially kicked off today at the regularly scheduled core development meeting. Andrew Nacin announced that 10up engineer <a href="http://werdswords.com/" target="_blank">Drew Jaynes</a> will be leading the release.</p>\n<p>Jaynes, who has contributed to every major release since 3.3, recently led the initiative to create inline documentation for every hook in WordPress. He will be accompanied by Scott Taylor, who will help guide core feature plugin development for the media and image efforts that will be in motion throughout 2015.</p>\n<p>The WordPress core team is planning three releases this year. &#8220;At the moment, that looks like one in April, one in August, and one in early December,&#8221; Nacin said. He anticipates that the WP REST API will see the light of day in 4.3 or 4.4, due later this year.</p>\n<p>Jaynes opened the meeting with discussion on <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1421875969001302" target="_blank">possible candidates for features in 4.2</a>, which are likely to include <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/" target="_blank">Press This</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-theme-switcher/" target="_blank">Theme Switcher</a>, and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29820" target="_blank">Shiny Updates</a> (smoother installation and updating of plugins and themes).

The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-2-project-schedule/" target="_blank">4.2 project schedule</a> is now updated with tentative dates for the release.

The service provides instant coding environments with support for code editing and a large array of popular programming languages and software components.</p>\n<p>By making the IDE available to users through the browser, Codio eliminates the hassle that educators experience when setting up development environments for students. Projects created in Codio are accessible both in the classroom and at home, which helps students continue their learning outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>Codio offers a <a href="https://codio.com/pricing/" target="_blank">free account</a> that gives you 256 MB memory per project and 2 GB storage per project. Other pricing tiers cater to teachers, students, schools, universities, and professionals. However, the free account is perfect for creating a quick development site with WordPress, and you can set it up in under five minutes.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a New Project</h2>\n<p>After creating an account with Codio, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a prompt to create a new project. Click through to get started with a new project that will contain your development environment.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-projects-screen.png" rel="prettyphoto[37626]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-projects-screen.png?resize=1025%2C812" alt="codio-projects-screen" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37632" /></a></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now have the opportunity to choose from three different starting points: an empty project, a starter pack, or a GitHub import. Select &#8220;a starter pack.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-create-project.png" rel="prettyphoto[37626]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-create-project.png?resize=1025%2C724" alt="codio-create-project" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37631" /></a></p>\n<p>This will take you to a page that lists all of Codio&#8217;s certified starter packs, which help you easily get started with technologies like Angular, Node + Express, Drupal, Ruby on Rails, and more. There are a dozen starter packs that are certified and supported by the Codio team.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-starter-packs.png" rel="prettyphoto[37626]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-starter-packs.png?resize=1025%2C724" alt="codio-starter-packs" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37633" /></a></p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a starter pack for WordPress that will automatically set up MySQL, Apache, and PHP. This makes the setup process quick and hassle-free, and you&#8217;ll be using the latest version of WordPress in just a couple minutes.</p>\n<p>After you select the WordPress starter pack, you&#8217;ll be returned to the project page. Free accounts are limited to public visibility on projects, so you may need to upgrade to the Pro plan if you require private projects.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Configure WordPress</h2>\n<p>After you complete the project setup, you&#8217;ll be dumped out onto the readme file for your project where you&#8217;ll find instructions for configuring and installing WordPress. If you&#8217;re bothered by non-capital P&#8217;s in WordPress, steady your nerves and remember that someone made this for you to use for free.</p>\n<p>Navigate to &#8220;Configure Project&#8221; in the top menu and then follow the instructions in the terminal to run the configuration script. When prompted for your password, press Enter. This is the only action you need to take during the process.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-configure-project.png" rel="prettyphoto[37626]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-configure-project.png?resize=1025%2C534" alt="codio-configure-project" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37630" /></a></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Install WordPress</h2>\n<p>Once configuration is complete, navigate to &#8220;WordPress Login&#8221; in the top menu. This will take you through the normal installation process.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-install.png" rel="prettyphoto[37626]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-install.png?resize=1025%2C658" alt="codio-wordpress-install" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37635" /></a></p>\n<p>Now you should be able to log in at the following URL:</p>\n<p><code>http://theory-opera.codio.io:3000/wordpress/wp-admin/</code></p>\n<h2>Step 4: Activate the Permalink Fix &#038; Disable Canonical Redirects Pack Plugin</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re in, the last required step is to go straight to plugins and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/permalink-fix-disable-canonical-redirects-pack/" target="_blank">Permalink Fix &amp; Disable Canonical Redirects Pack</a> plugin, which you&#8217;ll find pre-installed. Visit the front end like you normally would and you&#8217;ll see your shiny new WordPress site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-frontend.png" rel="prettyphoto[37626]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-frontend.png?resize=1025%2C569" alt="codio-wordpress-frontend" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37634" /></a></p>\n<p>The URL for your site will look something like this:</p>\n<p><code>http://theory-opera.codio.io:3000/wordpress/</code></p>\n<p>Within the Codio interface you can easily edit WordPress core, theme, and plugin files, as well as upload new files. If you have WordPress projects hosted on GitHub, you can easily import those into Codio to make changes and push those changes back to the repository.</p>\n<p>The cloud-based IDE is very similar to using <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-in-the-cloud-how-to-set-up-a-development-site-with-koding" target="_blank">WordPress on Koding</a> in many respects, and I found it equally easy to set up on both services. Both provide a quick way to do some testing, without having to set up a development environment on your local machine. If you decide to experiment and break everything, it&#8217;s safe and easy to start over. Codio&#8217;s friendly environment provides a great way to get your friends or children started with using WordPress.</p>\n<p>Since Codio was developed with educators in mind, the dashboard has a handful of helpful tutorials for learning about Git, an introduction to HTML and CSS, and an introduction Javascript.

Last year, Jarrett <a href="http://frankiejarrett.com/parting-ways-churchthemes-net-looking-ahead-toward-brighter-future/" target="_blank">sold ChurchThemes.net to Lift</a> co-founders Chris Wallace and Brad Miller. Since that time he has been focusing on product development for <a href="https://wp-stream.com/" target="_blank">WP Stream</a>, which has allowed him a few extra minutes to create some free extensions for WordPress.</p>\n<p>At the end of December and in early January, he released five small but highly useful plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/compact-view-mode/" target="_blank">Compact View Mode</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-session-control/" target="_blank">User Session Control</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/prevent-concurrent-logins/" target="_blank">Prevent Concurrent Logins</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api-force-ssl/" target="_blank">JSON REST API Force SSL</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/archived-post-status/" target="_blank">Archived Post Status</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several of his latest creations are handy for membership sites and web applications. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/archived-post-status/" target="_blank">Archived Post Status</a> caught my eye, because adds more flexibility for using WordPress as a CMS. The plugin adds a new post status that enables posts and pages to be archived. This effectively allows you to unpublish content without having to send it back to draft status.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-post-status-dropdown.png" rel="prettyphoto[37591]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-post-status-dropdown.png?resize=600%2C400" alt="archived-post-status-dropdown" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37611" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; default <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Status" target="_blank">post statuses</a> currently work very much like an on/off switch as far as a finished post is concerned. Of the eight default statuses, Published is the only one that is public, while all the rest remain behind the curtain in various states of unreadiness. None of the statuses, apart from Published, adequately indicate that a post is complete or finished.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, WordPress makes it possible for developers to register their own <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Status#Custom_Status" target="_blank">custom post statuses</a>, which is what Jarrett did with this plugin. He created it for sites where content is not always meant to be evergreen. It allows you to archive posts in the same way that you might archive email.</p>\n<p>Archived Post Status is compatible with posts, pages, and custom post types, giving you a wide array of possible use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Archive pages or posts from a conference or event for editing and re-use next year</li>\n<li>Archive real estate listings for records</li>\n<li>Cycle portfolio content in and out of the site as necessary</li>\n<li>Temporarily remove listings from a site that indexes businesses or organizations</li>\n<li>Archive products to bring back for future use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While custom post types seem to be one of the most likely uses for this plugin, you may not want to have the archived status available to all post types. Jarrett includes a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/archived-post-status/faq/" target="_blank">filter</a> that allows you to exclude the Archived status from appearing on certain post types.</p>\n<p>Some might be wondering why you wouldn&#8217;t use the Draft status, since the Archived post status essentially puts a post in the same state. To use drafts in this way would be to split its purpose into multiple uses, which are not clearly separated when sorting. If you are looking for previously published content that is complete, while hunting through all drafts in progress, you have to be fully knowledgeable of all the content on the site and use your memory to do the sorting. The archived status keeps everything nicely sorted for future use.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-posts-list-screen.png" rel="prettyphoto[37591]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-posts-list-screen.png?resize=600%2C400" alt="archived-posts-list-screen" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37614" /></a></p>\n<p>If you need a non-public archive of completed posts, this simple plugin will do the trick.

Sullivan shares details behind the attack, how it affected the bottom line, and says it was someone in the WordPress community who orchestrated the attack.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using some sophisticated techniques we were able to trace back to the source of the spam attack and unfortunately found out that the attack was started by someone within the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>They did everything through a third-party, an internet hitman of sorts, to try to cover their tracks, but they weren’t quite careful enough and we were able to uncover where everything started.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead of naming the individual, Sullivan left a message aimed specifically at the person responsible, &#8220;The only reason I even mention it is so that hopefully, that person reads this, and knows that what they’re doing is impacting the livelihood’s of people and their families.&#8221; It&#8217;s this message which has me wondering, is it time to name and shame people in the WordPress community?</p>\n<h2>The Good</h2>\n<p>In my experience, the community rarely calls people out, even if they have <a title="http://womenofwp.org/2014/01/how-to-report-harassment-at-wordcamps/" href="http://womenofwp.org/2014/01/how-to-report-harassment-at-wordcamps/">routinely harassed others</a> at a WordCamp. Instead, we usually find out about them through back channels. By calling people out, it warns others and makes everyone aware of the situation.</p>\n<h2>The Bad</h2>\n<p>Naming and shaming creates the potential for libel and defamation lawsuits. The internet has a long memory and if a person changes for the better, it will be hard to forget mistakes made in the past. It could hurt future employment opportunities as employers do background checks using Google. There&#8217;s likely a lot of unintended consequences as well.</p>\n<h2>Judge and Jury</h2>\n<p>I doubt the community will start calling people out, as it creates anger, grief, and drama. Besides, who are we to act as judge and jury? However, it bothers me to know that an unnamed person is negatively impacting the livelihood of WordPress businesses and people.</p>\n<p>On one hand, I want to see the individual dealt with in the public sphere and turned into an example. On the other, I feel it&#8217;s probably not the best way to go about it. Maybe the system already in place is the best way to handle these types of situations? Write a post, raise awareness, and tell others who to watch out for in the back channel.

Each year, the event donates a portion of its proceeds to <a href="http://www.stjude.org">St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital</a>. Pagely Co-founder, Joshua Strebel, says the decision to donate to St. Jude was made long before he and his wife had kids, &#8220;St Jude has been our charity of choice for many years. Even before Sally and I had kids, we were touched by those commercials that showed the kids fighting cancer. I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot for kids, coming from a large family. Of all the charities you could give to, St. Jude is a no brainer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since 2012, the event has donated over $11K to St. Jude Hospital and Strebel says funding from PressNomics 3 this year will allow them to donate over $10K to a <em>charity yet to be named</em>. &#8220;After PressNomics 1, we donated a little over $5K and there was an anonymous matching donation. After PressNomics 2, we donated a little over $6K. This year the budget has allowed us to donate just over $10K.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>DonorsChoose.org</h2>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DonorsChooseImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[37461]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37501" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DonorsChooseImage.png?resize=1025%2C527" alt="DonorsChoose" /></a><br />\nWhen I reached out to the community to figure out who gives to charities, I discovered a number of people who use <a title="http://www.donorschoose.org/" href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">DonorsChoose</a>. DonorsChoose is an organization that makes it easy to help classrooms in need. Public school teachers post classroom project requests, which range from pencils for poetry to microscopes for mitochondria-organization.</p>\n<p><a title="https://eamann.com/" href="https://eamann.com/">Eric Mann</a>, who contributes to the organization, had a lot of friends in college who majored in education and went on to become teachers. He discovered that many of them worked in schools with small budgets and limited supplies. He explains why he uses DonorsChoose.org.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I use DonorsChoose.org to help fund the purchase of books for classroom lessons, field trips to museums and science exhibits, and modern laptop computers for technical education. Many of the teachers I sponsor are working in low-income areas with at-risk youth and don&#8217;t have the tools available to make much of a difference without community sponsorship.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mann believes investing in education is one of the best long-term investments you can make, &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to spend money on this Kickstarter or that IndieGoGo when you get a tangible (or digital) return on the investment. Spending money to help protect and shepherd the education of today&#8217;s youth, though, returns an investment in better educated leaders, educators, and technologists for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>WP Site Care</h2>\n<p>WordPress support agency, <a title="http://www.wpsitecare.com" href="http://www.wpsitecare.com">WP Site Care</a>, contributed to <a title="http://www.wpsitecare.com/5-minutes-reflection-look-back-2014/" href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/5-minutes-reflection-look-back-2014/">several different organizations and initiatives</a> throughout 2014.

We found out about a number of causes from the WordPress community itself. For example, funding treatment for autism is something that has a personal impact on a few of us at WP Site Care.</p>\n<p>We like to make sure that the causes that are important to individuals become important for all of us collectively. It not only goes to help the causes themselves, but helps us get closer as a working family.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Individuals Who Received Financial Assistance From The WordPress Community</h2>\n<p><strong>Just Tadlock</strong> &#8211; Near the end of 2013, Justin Tadlock <a title="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/12/17/help-me-get-a-house-for-christmas" href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/12/17/help-me-get-a-house-for-christmas">discovered the perfect house</a>, but he didn&#8217;t have the money to cover closing costs, quarterly taxes, and appliances. He requested $5K to cover his costs, but he ended up receiving over $7K. It&#8217;s important to note that the campaign took place around Christmas which is a tough time financially for a number of people. However, the community rallied together to give Tadlock the ultimate Christmas gift.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan Griffiths</strong> &#8211; Dan Griffiths, who is known on Twitter as <a title="https://twitter.com/ghost1227" href="https://twitter.com/ghost1227">Ghost1227</a> and one of the creators of <a title="http://wptally.com/" href="http://wptally.com/">WP Tally,</a> recently found himself in a financial emergency.

He wasn&#8217;t able to start the job, putting him in a financial bind. He <a title="http://www.gofundme.com/wpmom" href="http://www.gofundme.com/wpmom">created a campaign</a> asking for $1K to help pay bills as he mourned the loss of his mother. Within 42 minutes, 8 people raised $760 of the requested $1,000.

Petrova, a marketing expert and long-time food blogger, is a member of both the WordPress community and the larger tech community in Bulgaria. She has also worked as an organizer for many local technical conferences over the years.</p>\n<p>Her motivation to address the widespread problem of depression in IT grew out of personal experiences with friends and co-workers who were struggling with it. This put her on the path to research the disease and find ways to raise awareness on the topic. I had the opportunity to interview Petrova after the event, and it&#8217;s easy to see why she is a person to whom people would come for advice. Her warm, empathetic personality is combined with a rare willingness to listen to others.</p>\n<p>Petrova&#8217;s experience in food blogging gives her a format for talking about depression in a way that people can understand, which helps to mitigate the stigma that surrounds the issue. We&#8217;ll take a look at some of the recipes she shared in her presentation, but first it&#8217;s important to have a basic understanding of depression.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Depression</h2>\n<p>Nearly everyone knows someone who is suffering from depression, as it afflicts more than <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/" target="_blank">350 million people</a> of all ages worldwide and is the leading cause of disability. In the most extreme cases it can lead to suicide.</p>\n<p>Clinical depression is the most severe form, which is often treated with psychological and pharmacological therapies. However, many more people suffer from milder forms of depression from time to time.</p>\n<p>In his TED talk, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo" target="_blank">Depression, The Secret We Share</a>, writer Andrew Solomon said, <strong>&#8220;The opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality.&#8221;</strong> He describes his own dark journey of struggling with depression, which he noticed when all the normal activities of life and work began to seem like too much.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it&#8217;s ridiculous. You know it&#8217;s ridiculous while you&#8217;re experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages, and eat lunch, and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door, and that it&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>\n<p>And yet you are in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity, and then the anxiety set in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Solomon notes that people tend to confuse depression, grief, and sadness, but understanding the trajectory and duration of these feelings will help to clarify the situation. While grief is explicitly reactive and related to loss, depression doesn&#8217;t always have an easily identifiable cause. Some forms of depression will require professional help for the person to regain a semblance of normal living.</p>\n<h2>Sources or Triggers of Depression in IT</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/emergency.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37466]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/emergency.jpg?resize=1024%2C482" alt="photo credit: Code & Martini by Ivana Vasilj - cc license" class="size-full wp-image-21873" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://flic.kr/p/dLUWMb">Code &#038; Martini</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivanavasilj/">Ivana Vasilj</a> &#8211; cc license\n<p>Depression in the IT industry can be more difficult to address, as many tech workers are intelligent, independent, and in high demand. Three years ago, when Yana Petrova and her colleague first proposed a presentation on depression for a local tech conference, she experienced a great deal of resistance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There were a lot of discussions surrounding it and people in the organizations were hesitant to include it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They believed that people who are in IT are earning very well, the people who are suffering should just go to the doctor, there&#8217;s no need to discuss it at a technical conference.&#8221; The presentation was so impactful, however, that some of the top Bulgarian psychologists heard about it and encouraged them to continue raising awareness.</p>\n<p>The IT industry has several unique factors that seem to contribute to depression and anxiety. Many people in the WordPress community, in particular, work alone at home as freelancers or with distributed companies. Unless the individual is motivated, this work environment can severely limit healthy social interactions. Additional pressures can also lead to periods of depression, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client work and relationships</li>\n<li>Pressure to always be connected</li>\n<li>Interaction with the larger development community</li>\n<li>An industry emphasis on high competency forces workers to continue building skills on top of ever-changing technologies, while also completing daily work</li>\n<li>Not understanding the limits of your body/emotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I think that most of the time they are trying to become really good at what they are doing, which requires most of their attention and most of their time,&#8221; Petrova said, commenting on the lifestyle of many developers with whom she is connected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you are reading code, coding most of your time, and doing things related to coding, then a social part is missing &#8211; the part related to relationships, self-esteem, knowing yourself. You&#8217;re just not going deeper into that, because you are giving your time and attention to something else, trying to be good at something else. Our brain resources are kind of limited.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Client interaction is also a major cause of stress and anxiety for self-employed professionals. When you work from home by yourself without a team, criticism from clients can have a severe impact on your feelings of self-worth. If you don&#8217;t have a healthy reservoir of outside interests and hobbies, you can easily become mired in client negativity.</p>\n<p>During Petrova&#8217;s presentation at WordCamp Europe, she received questions about how to deal with clients who can damage a developer&#8217;s self-confidence. Sometimes clients don&#8217;t understand that they are not working with machines but rather real people with families and lives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because a lot of people are working from home, what the client thinks and what the community thinks about their work can be a source of depression,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, a lot of people have mentioned that clients are sometimes rude in explaining how incompetent they were.&#8221; This can have a devastating impact on a developer who is lacking self-confidence, outside social connections, and restorative hobbies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Questions about clients wasn&#8217;t something I expected, but it&#8217;s another vertical to explore,&#8221; Petrova said. It has inspired her to start working on a talk about relationships, clients, teams, and how to preserve your team.</p>\n<p>Petrova has observed that many people working in IT don&#8217;t prioritize knowing themselves and understanding their reactions, although this is not unique to the IT industry. They are often blind to their mental health issues and don&#8217;t know when to seek help.</p>\n<h2>Tips for Dealing with Depression and Anxiety</h2>\n<p>Petrova&#8217;s presentation centered around ways to prevent depression and successfully cope with work-related stress and anxiety. &#8220;Depression is not something that defines you for a lifetime,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It might be just a problem, and it might be that, at this time, happiness requires more effort for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She believes that depression is an important mechanism in the human consciousness. &#8220;It&#8217;s a signal for us that change is necessary &#8211; changes about us or changes somewhere around us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Petrova compares cooking recipes to recipes for coping with depression, noting that it&#8217;s important to adapt those recipes to work with your preferences and needs. Her presentation highlights five ways that you can discover and create your own recipes for preventing depression from setting in.</p>\n<h4>1. Take deep breaths.</h4>\n<p>Deep breathing practices help you to regain calmness and perspective. &#8220;They say that graveyards are full of irreplaceable people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, we all are, but it&#8217;s more important that we are alive, we are here, and we are happy. We can never control everything in the world, and we should never try to take responsibility for all the things here. We often tend to forget that our bodies have their limits and we are fragile.&#8221; Deep breathing reminds us that we are not machines.</p>\n<p>In addition to breathing, Petrova suggests finding other activities outside of work that will help you to gain perspective on life. &#8220;Dedicate special time for your recipes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Start spending an hour in the morning with your coffee. Spend Sunday afternoon with someone or with friends,&#8221; she suggests.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;But never give away this time. Never give it away for work. Never replace it for something, never sacrifice it. It&#8217;s important that you keep this thing and slow down.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<h4>2. Make lists.</h4>\n<p>Petrova advises people to make lists of recipes that work for them in preparation for moments when it&#8217;s difficult to think clearly. &#8220;Think of those lists as emergency plans. When the grey veil of depression comes, your rituals may not seem as important or as life-saving as the day before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You might not enjoy them as you did before, so you should have a list of things.&#8221; Perhaps it&#8217;s a list of movies you wanted watch, or places you wanted to visit, a restaurant or recipe you wanted to try.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the beginning you won&#8217;t be willing to do anything from this list. Those things will look silly and you say no this is not the time to do this. You will be preoccupied with all of your worries right now. Force yourself and just pick a thing and start doing it. Start those lists today and obey them frequently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Petrova shared a few simple items on her own list &#8211; i.e. eating avocados, making herself a chai latte, enjoying a local spicy soup. If you maintain a clear list of things that make you feel better, you have some activities to turn to when things start to become stressful at work.</p>\n<h4>3. Provide small wins.</h4>\n<p>Make goals for yourself that put you on the path to success with frequent, small milestones. This will help to keep you oriented towards fulfillment. &#8220;Another recipe of mine was to keep an editorial calendar,&#8221; Petrova said. &#8220;Even if I am not feeling well, I already had something planned, so I can keep moving in that direction.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>4. Think about your thinking.</h4>\n<p>People who excel at solving some of tech&#8217;s most complex problems can also be notoriously masterful at avoiding introspection. Petrova approaches the topic of introspection with the idea of &#8220;debugging yourself,&#8221; a concept with which many in tech are familiar.</p>\n<p>She suggests writing your own user manual to document how you work and what keeps you healthy. &#8220;Write your own user manual. Start writing a user manual for yourself and imagine you are giving it to someone else. This will help you think more about how you are thinking,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can see that there are a lot of small hacks that can help you feel better. Just imagine how empowering it might be to discover more,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This requires a lot of patience and dedication. It usually takes time for reading and time for writing. It takes time to debug your mind.&#8221; Petrova suggests writing down all of the things that help your mind work better so that you have that manual for when depression tries to settle in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Debug yourself, but if you can&#8217;t do it yourself, then try to talk to someone,&#8221; Petrova said. &#8220;We cannot resolve anything by ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>5. Learn to listen, learn to share.</h4>\n<p>You can never underestimate the importance of community in maintaining your mental health. The community is stronger when people overcome their irrational inhibitions and learn to share their stories and listen to each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really easy to listen the proper way, but you can sometimes save people by listening to them carefully,&#8221; Petrova said. &#8220;You can empower them by listening to them.</p>\n<p>People need to tell their stories to realize what is happening. Sometimes when you are keeping things only in your head, you are not realizing the power of your situation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When should depression lead you to seek professional help? &#8220;In some official resources, they say if you are feeling like this for four weeks then go find some help,&#8221; Petrova said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I think that the more you are getting to know yourself, the more you can feel if you need to meet with someone or talk with someone. The doctor might not be the first person. The first person might be a friend or a relative or someone who is closer to you. Or just someone you see, someone you believe in and decide to tell your story to. I really believe that it&#8217;s powerful to tell stories.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Staying Healthy and Preventing Depression</h2>\n<p>Petrova recommends a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Healthy-Programmer-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1937785319" target="_blank">The Healthy Programmer</a>, which contains the basics of healthy living for people who work most of the time in a seated position. She believes that movement is especially important for those who work from home and set their own schedules.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first thing is related to moving/movement. Are you moving enough? Are you doing active things, sports? This is really important, because if you are living where you are working, then you can find yourself in a situation where you are staying home, ordering food all the time. You forget all the healthy things you could do to feel better, for your body to feel better and your mind to work well. It&#8217;s really related.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re staying active and able to use your normal problem-solving skills to debug yourself, you will greatly lessen the chances of falling into depression. Building up these habits takes time, but you&#8217;re also less likely to be crippled by stress and anxiety. In the future, Petrova plans to start a blog called &#8220;The Happiness Cookbook&#8221; in order to encourage people to share their recipes with the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Get to know yourself better and your reactions to different situations,&#8221; Petrova advises. &#8220;You really need a lot of time to know what&#8217;s happening to you and to know how to react in a timely way for prevention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We all have our stressful moments. We all have our sad moments. You are certain to have them in your lifetime. But you can learn how to prevent your reactions, what to do when depression happens, and the best way to overcome it. The temporary feelings can be over at some point with the help of simple tips, and then you are not going to get depressed. Otherwise, you are just digging into that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Obviously, there are some forms of depression that will ultimately require professional help. Petrova&#8217;s tips for prevention are intended to help folks before they reach a very dark place where they have lost interest in work completely and are struggling to find vitality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Depression means that you need to change something, for yourself, around yourself, about yourself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is the key message. Just research the pain that made you feel like this and start debugging it step by step.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 22:39:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Matt: Pope Francis on Climate Change";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44598";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"http://ma.tt/2015/01/pope-francis-on-climate-change/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:718:"<blockquote><p>He has been called the “superman pope”, and it would be hard to deny that Pope Francis has had a good December.

When I write content, I often hit the preview button several times to review changes. This results in DFW mode turning on and off multiple times which I find distracting and at times, annoying. I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way as Brian Krogsgard of <a title="https://poststatus.com/distraction-free-writing-wordpress/" href="https://poststatus.com/distraction-free-writing-wordpress/">PostStatus.com explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I write, I tend to save and preview the post live a number of times while I’m writing, especially toward the end of my time spent writing.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit dizzying to be fixing typos and saving and previewing while going in an out of DFW.</p>\n<p>I’d like to see “Save Draft” and “Preview” buttons moved into the editor body, so that I can stay in DFW while finishing up my posts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the idea of moving the Save Draft and Preview buttons to the post editor. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why <a title="http://wptavern.com/how-to-preview-posts-in-distraction-free-writing-mode-without-seeing-a-transition" href="http://wptavern.com/how-to-preview-posts-in-distraction-free-writing-mode-without-seeing-a-transition">I reviewed</a> the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-preview-button/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-preview-button/">Distraction Free Preview Button</a> plugin by Alex King. Krogsgard also lists several other ideas with screenshots showing the changes in action, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inverted editor colors</li>\n<li>Centered post editor</li>\n<li>Setting the editor to use the Max-width available</li>\n<li>Full-height editor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jen Mylo, who reviewed the feature as a user, <a title="http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/" href="http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/">suggests</a> similar improvements. One other thing I&#8217;d like to see is a full-height editor. It&#8217;s annoying when the meta boxes fade away, the editor remains the same size as if the boxes are still in place. That&#8217;s because they are, but I think it would be better if DFW mode would go back to being a separate writing experience so meta boxes are a non-issue.</p>\n<p>I believe if the ideas proposed by Krogsgard and Mylo are implemented, DFW would likely become the primary mode in which I write content. Until then, I&#8217;m sticking with the default interface. What you do you think of the proposed ideas and are there any you&#8217;d add?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 22:09:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: JavaScript Leads The Pack in RedMonk’s Programming Language Rankings";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37449";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wptavern.com/javascript-leads-the-pack-in-redmonks-programming-language-rankings";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2289:"<p>Research and analyst firm, <a title="http://redmonk.com/" href="http://redmonk.com/">RedMonk, </a>released its <a title="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/" href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/">programming language rankings</a> for January 2015.

It changed from a <em>you have to toggle to it every time</em> feature to <em>it&#8217;s always on feature</em> in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>With that change, the DFW experience changed to be more like the regular editor, well, because it is the regular editor. It just removes stuff off of the screen that you&#8217;re not using.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the editor now, with DFW not on:</p>\n<div id="attachment_7393" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-1-post-editor.png"><img class="wp-image-7393 size-large" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-1-post-editor-752x473.png" alt="4-1-post-editor" width="752" height="473" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The WordPress post editor, as of WordPress 4.1 (with custom admin theme colors)</p></div>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the editor now, with DFW on:</p>\n<div id="attachment_7390" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-wp-4-1.png"><img class="wp-image-7390 size-large" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-wp-4-1-752x442.png" alt="dfw-wp-4-1" width="752" height="442" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">DFW mode as of WordPress 4.1</p></div>\n<p>Jen Mylo wrote a post about how <a href="http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/">she doesn&#8217;t like the new feature as much as the old one</a>. I&#8217;ve seen similar complaints a few times from folks.</p>\n<p>The positive trade-off is that now DFW is much more likely to be used, since the setting (the four-arrow icon in the upper right corner of the editor box) is persistent for a user once enabled. Previously, DFW had to be toggled in each use, and was probably used by a minority of users.</p>\n<p>4.1 was the first go at the feature in its new state, and I think it&#8217;s pretty great. I&#8217;m now using DFW every post I write, whereas before I almost always forgot to turn it on; plus, it previously felt like a commitment to the blog post.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I think Jen&#8217;s critique (as well as others&#8217;) are noteworthy, so I decided to take some of the complaints I&#8217;ve heard and hack around in the browser inspector to see if I could alleviate them.</p>\n<p>One thing Jen brought up was the height of the editor box. You no longer toggle the height from the bottom corner; instead it auto-adjusts with your content, and comes shipped with a default height.</p>\n<h3>Full-height editor box</h3>\n<p>She believes, and I agree, that it would be nice if the editor filled the available height of the window, because right now it feels a bit squished and cramped. Thankfully, we have the viewport height (vh) unit in CSS, and this can be adjusted with pure CSS and a few media queries.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7391" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-4-1-full-height.png"><img class="wp-image-7391 size-large" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-4-1-full-height-752x451.png" alt="dfw-4-1-full-height" width="752" height="451" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress DFW mode with full-height content area</p></div>\n<p>I think this is a progressive feature, so I&#8217;d be for using the vh CSS unit not using Javascript on this, despite the not-great browser support in IE.</p>\n<p>In fact, I really like this concept, even when not in DFW mode. It really calms me down, not seeing the metaboxes below the post content right out of the gate. We can just keep them right below the editor, just out of sight.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7392" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post-editor-full-height.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-7392" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post-editor-full-height-752x451.png" alt="WordPress post editor with full height content area" width="752" height="451" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress post editor with full height content area</p></div>\n<h3>Centered editor in DFW</h3>\n<p>Another note Jen made was that she was bothered the editor isn&#8217;t centered in DFW mode. Well, I&#8217;ve never noticed that, but <em>now I do, ugh</em>. <img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> It&#8217;s this way because DFW simply hides the right column and admin columns, which are not the same width, and therefore the editor is left with unequal margins.</p>\n<p>Well, during the transition of those admin columns, theoretically, we could also move the editor box, though I think we should test what kind of UX effect there is of transitioning the editor your cursor is in. It might not be the most elegant solution.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, here&#8217;s what it&#8217;d look like once you&#8217;re done, including the full-height editor box.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7394" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-full-height-and-centered.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-7394" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-full-height-and-centered-752x471.png" alt="DFW full-height editor and centered" width="752" height="471" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">DFW full-height editor and centered</p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m iffy on this one. I really don&#8217;t like the idea of moving the box you&#8217;re actively focusing on. Needs testing.</p>\n<h3>Max-width on the editor box</h3>\n<p>A critique I learned from another user was that the huge width on the DFW editor box bothered them. I agree. I think we should put a max-width on the editor box &#8212; probably whether the user is in DFW mode or not.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the large version that&#8217;s unwieldy, especially in DFW mode:</p>\n<div id="attachment_7400" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-max-width.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-7400" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-max-width-752x285.png" alt="We should not let this get so wide. Line length matters!" width="752" height="285" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We should not let this get so wide. Line length matters!</p></div>\n<h3>Inverted editor colors, with centered content box</h3>\n<p>One more idea: what if we inverted the WordPress admin colors, so that the background was white, and metaboxes were gray. And then, we could ditch the &#8220;container&#8221; of the editor box altogether.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a mockup of that.</p>\n<div id="attachment_7402" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-white-admin-background.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7402" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-white-admin-background-752x431.jpg" alt="All white background, with centered editor" width="752" height="431" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">All white background, with centered editor</p></div>\n<p>I think this could look really nice, but it would require a good bit of admin changes.</p>\n<p>And then the Distraction-Free Writing version:</p>\n<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-all-white.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7404" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-all-white-752x432.jpg" alt="dfw-all-white" width="752" height="432" /></a></p>\n<h3>Save and Preview inline</h3>\n<p>This one is my own idea, based on drafting posts in this mode every day.</p>\n<p>Distraction-Free Writing toggles on and off pretty rapidly as you focus in and out of the editor. When I write, I tend to save and preview the post live a number of times while I&#8217;m writing, especially toward the end of my time spent writing.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit dizzying to be fixing typos and saving and previewing while going in an out of DFW.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see &#8220;Save Draft&#8221; and &#8220;Preview&#8221; buttons moved into the editor body, so that I can stay in DFW while finishing up my posts. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>\n<div id="attachment_7389" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-inline-save-preview.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7389" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-inline-save-preview-752x473.jpg" alt="DFW with Save and Preview inline" width="752" height="473" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">DFW with Save and Preview inline</p></div>\n<h3>Iteration is important</h3>\n<p>Iteration in WordPress feature development is important. I&#8217;m glad we introduced Distraction-Free Writing in the first place, and I think the changes in 4.1 are worthy. They may need some adjustments, but it&#8217;s a process that will continue to improve.</p>\n<p>Constructive feedback is always good. The more we use and figure out how others are using various features of WordPress, the more they can be improved.</p>\n<p>In preparing to write this post, I was able to reach out in <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/planet/feed/slack.wordpress.org">WordPress Slack</a> and find out the best venue to give feedback, and if Jen&#8217;s post and this one help start a conversation, the changes can make their way to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac tickets</a> and eventual patches to make WordPress better.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen at least a handful of folks say &#8220;Bring the old Distraction-Free Writing back!&#8221; That&#8217;s understandable; lots of folks don&#8217;t like change. Every UI-involved feature in WordPress ever has had critics.</p>\n<p>But when you look at WordPress today and WordPress 5 or more years ago, WordPress today is way more beautiful to use. That&#8217;s because the experience the core team has built has iterated over time in response to use, feedback, and contributions.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 18:01:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Jen Mylo: Distraction-free Writing Mode";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"http://jenmylo.com/?p=4787";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6729:"<p>Once upon a time in WordPress there was a New Feature called Distraction-free writing mode.

All the navigation and meta boxes now faded away while you were writing, and I thought, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s pretty nice, kind of a DFW Lite!&#8221; I didn&#8217;t pay too much attention, as I was just writing a quick post, but in my head I approved, and thought it was a good improvement. Until this morning.</p>\n<p>Most of my blog-based activity happens on work-related blogs that have front-end posting forms, so it&#8217;s been a while since I tried to access DFW mode. But I was going to be writing a long post, and I wanted to go over into that peaceful screen, so I clicked on the full-screen icon. That&#8217;s when I discovered that what I thought was DFW Lite was actually the new DFW. There was no more new screen.</p>\n<p>At first I thought,&#8221;Hm, that&#8217;s a lot more efficient. Good for them!&#8221; Then I started writing, and thought, &#8220;[Letters-in-a-configuration-to-replicate-my-slightly-alarmed-and-uncomfortable-sound]!&#8221; I hated to admit it, but I felt physically uncomfortable. Am I turning into Sheldon (<a title="Video from Big Bang Theory" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynUfxitGpfU">skip to 3:34</a>)? Crap! Anyway, here&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t love the new DFW.</p>\n<p>When wp core switched over to the &#8220;toolbar anchors to top of editor no matter how long your post&#8221; setup, users lost the ability to grab a corner of the editor and drag it to make it taller. Since it is supposed to automatically resize as you write, most people thought this was a tradeoff with a net benefit, and even though I really didn&#8217;t want to lose my little corner resize handle, I agreed that the net benefit was worth it. The thing is, if in your head you&#8217;ve already thought out a long post, starting in the small box feels cramped, kind of like when you have to repack a sleeping bag and you&#8217;re smooshing it with all your might to get it to fit back into the compact stuff sack.</p>\n<p>Think about opening a New Document in MS Word (or equivalent writing program) , or a writer putting a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter (for those who are too young to remember, <a title="Video of someone putting paper into a typewriter" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkUXn5bOwzk">it&#8217;s like this</a>). There have been reams written by famous authors in the past about the feeling that action engenders &#8212; a feeling of limitless possibilities, a knock on the creative door, an open road ahead. That&#8217;s what DFW tried to emulate. Starting in the small box instead of the full height box feels like possibilities with limits, a creative window that won&#8217;t open more than 3 inches for safety, a road with one lane closed for construction. Thoughts scrunch down to try to fit into the available space.</p>\n<p>Even when the box expands to be the height of the screen (minus padding against top and bottom of browser), a chunk of space is lost at the top for the toolbar. That fade it used to have really did remove distraction. I wish there had been a way to combine the zen of the fade away (Matt&#8217;s original nickname for DFW was zen mode) with the convenience of the always-at-top placement.</p>\n<p>In the old DFW, the writing window really did have that feeling of a fresh New Document or crisp new sheet of paper. Now, even once it&#8217;s tall, it&#8217;s a bit off-center to the left, because that&#8217;s where the editor box is when on a screen containing navigation and metaboxes.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4798" src="https://jenmylo.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-17-at-7-54-33-am.png?w=520&h=313" alt="Screenshot of current distraction-free mode" width="520" height="313" /></p>\n<p>There was a time (pre-2000) when I didn&#8217;t think too much about alignment in UIs. Then I got a lot of design ideas drilled into my head that stuck, especially regarding alignment. I like asymmetry in a lot of things, always have. Hell, in a site we were just working on one of the things we said we wanted was some asymmetry. But for DFW, the symmetry &#8212; the centeredness &#8212; was a big part of what made that screen so calming. Your brain didn&#8217;t have to do any pattern recognition or internal balancing to make it feel right. But now it skews to the left and it&#8217;s driving me crazy, Sheldon style. This isn&#8217;t zen for me; it&#8217;s a misused apostrophe, a lowercase p, a cabinet door left open.</p>\n<p>I thought I&#8217;d be a holdout forever against using the new <a title="wordpress.com" href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> posting interface (I have a lot of issues with it, surprise), but, well, their DFW has that open and symmetrical feeling (even if it has other problems) that makes for a non-Sheldony writing experience.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4789" src="https://jenmylo.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-17-at-7-27-45-am.png?w=520&h=378" alt="Screenshot of distraction-free writing mode on wordpress.com" width="520" height="378" /></p>\n<p>So this might be my last post written in wp-admin DFW mode for now.

When SIDEKICK Co-founder, Ben Fox, showed off the initial demo last year, I described it as the <a title="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html" href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a> of WordPress.</p>\n<p>SIDEKICK has a <a title="http://www.sidekick.pro/plans/create_wp_walkthroughs/" href="http://www.sidekick.pro/plans/create_wp_walkthroughs/">couple different plans</a> available depending upon how many walkthroughs you want to publish.

To supply audio, you need to upload a pre-recorded mp3 file for each step. While not as easy as recording the audio within the plugin, it&#8217;s easier to fix mishaps without having to redo the entire walkthrough.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WalkthroughInterface.png" rel="prettyphoto[37315]"><img class="size-full wp-image-37432" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WalkthroughInterface.png?resize=1025%2C280" alt="Walkthrough Interface" /></a>Walkthrough Interface\n<h2>It&#8217;s Clearly The First Version</h2>\n<p>While testing SIDEKICK, I encountered several things that need to be addressed in future versions. <del>During the initial setup, there is a box that explains how to build your own walkthrough with a link to get Composer. This leads me to believe that it&#8217;s a separate product or plugin when in reality, it&#8217;s not.

With so many steps in the setup process, it would be nice if SIDEKICK had a walkthrough of its own, to guide users on how to configure it. Despite these minor setbacks, they don&#8217;t detract from its usefulness. Fox says, the team is already aware of the issues and over the next few weeks, will release several updates.</p>\n<p>It took awhile, but once I understood how it works, I found creating walkthroughs a fairly easy process. With version one out the door, it will be interesting to see how it&#8217;s adopted by theme and plugin developers, considering a number of them already use <a title="http://theme.fm/2011/09/introducing-pointers-in-wordpress-3-3-2407/" href="http://theme.fm/2011/09/introducing-pointers-in-wordpress-3-3-2407/">admin pointers</a> that are built into WordPress.

But I&#8217;ve always been too greedy to do so, because I like to own my content, and I&#8217;ve never had a topic that I really wanted to write about that didn&#8217;t better fit on my personal blog or this one.</p>\n<p>That changed today, so I got to experiment. On hearing that Teehan+Lax shut down, I felt it was a worthy time to try Medium. I had a bone to pick with their exit post, and they helped design Medium&#8217;s first version, so it seemed fitting.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/@krogsgard/the-story-teehan-lax-isnt-telling-5b58e6109e88">a link to the finished product</a>. Until today, I had never really done anything to play with their editor beyond look at it and write a few sentences to see the basics of how things worked.</p>\n<h3>First impressions of Medium&#8217;s editor</h3>\n<p>Medium&#8217;s front-end is beautiful. And the back-end looks quite similar. They try to take pretty much everything out of your way to leave you to your words. I like that.</p>\n<p>The only problem with simplicity is that it can obfuscate how to actually do stuff. In the case of the Medium editor, there are two methods to interact with text.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7370" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medium-more-options-752x261.jpg" alt="medium-more-options" width="752" height="261" /></p>\n<p>First, you can click the little plus button, which allows you to insert a pre-formatted block of something.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7371" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medium-tooltip-752x208.jpg" alt="medium-tooltip" width="752" height="208" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, you can highlight text and get a tooltip of formatting options.</p>\n<p>Some of these options are confusing. The tooltip one was fine, but the + button was tougher. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect by clicking the horizontal line or the play button. I thought the code brackets were odd, as surely not many people are putting code on Medium. It turned out that was an oEmbed button.</p>\n<p>Eventually though, I figured out roughly how to do what, even inserting those big full screen images everyone associates to Medium.</p>\n<p>For most people and most posts, these tools are enough. And all in all the experience was delightful, despite this minor criticism. However, a part of me wanted <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>I like the persistent editing buttons of WordPress (though I could definitely do with fewer options in TinyMCE). I even felt a little weird about Medium&#8217;s previews. It&#8217;s basically a front-end preview when you edit, but it&#8217;s also not quite teh same. For example, you don&#8217;t get the below post items and other elements that affect the overall feel of the page, versus just the article.</p>\n<p>Still, I think the WordPress editing experience could learn from Medium&#8217;s efforts, even if we don&#8217;t mimic it entirely. And I do think the recent changes to Distraction writing help get us there.</p>\n<h3>Simple but effective stats</h3>\n<p>Medium has stats built-in. With WordPress, most people use WordPress.com&#8217;s stats module through Jetpack, or Google Analytics, or both.</p>\n<p>Medium really trims down the stats information. You basically get a few metrics: Views, &#8220;Reads&#8221;, Read Ratio, and Recommendation counts.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7372" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medium-stats-752x527.jpg" alt="medium-stats" width="752" height="527" /></p>\n<p>I <em>love</em> the read ratio stat. Medium&#8217;s reliance on reading versus pageviews is <a href="https://medium.com/data-lab/mediums-metric-that-matters-total-time-reading-86c4970837d5">pretty well documented</a>, and I&#8217;ve always thought it was great. But what I realized nearly immediately is that this gave me much greater assurance that my post is quality or not, versus metrics I have available to me with WordPress.com stats or even Google analytics.</p>\n<p>I usually determine quality of my posts based on how many tweets, comments, and pageviews I get for an article. This is great, but just because something isn&#8217;t shareworthy doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not high quality. Also, if I get 200 views but nearly everyone fully reads it, it&#8217;s better than getting 1,000 views where only 200 read it.</p>\n<p>In the latter example, I got views but I didn&#8217;t impact. My goal is to impact, and Medium&#8217;s &#8220;reads&#8221; stat helps me determine that very quickly.</p>\n<p>Referrals are also nice on Medium. I can quickly see where traffic is coming from, real time, and go see what that referring source said about my post or take part in the conversations.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, regarding referrals, is that <em>I can see them per article</em>. This is a feature I would love to see hit WordPress.com stats.</p>\n<p>Hardcore stats folks won&#8217;t be totally satisfied with Medium. And to my knowledge, you can add your own Google Analytics account to your medium account, so you have to live with what you get. For most of us, that is enough.</p>\n<p>I think there is a ton of opportunity for a solid stats plugin for WordPress that either makes great use of Google Analytics within the WordPress Dashboard, or rolls their own (outside of WordPress.com / Jetpack).</p>\n<h3>Medium-sized exposure</h3>\n<p>One element I was pretty curious of was exposure. I know that some articles have done really well on Medium, but I&#8217;m not sure what causes that.</p>\n<p>In my case, the article has had a couple thousand pageviews in a matter of an hour or two, so that&#8217;s great. However, I think it took off on Twitter and Designer News much more so than from Medium itself, besides recommendations</p>\n<p>For recommendations, it&#8217;s like a rolling snowball. I get emails from Medium every day telling me what my Twitter friends recommended on Medium. I imagine that the more people recommend my story, the more email and other distribution the story gets. That&#8217;s good, because I&#8217;ve always figured recommendation buttons were mostly useless on sites, and really only social proof for other would-be readers that are already on some kind of archive.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, Medium doesn&#8217;t really have a way to highlight new stories beyond recommendations. And they very much de-emphasize post dates and time-based feeds.</p>\n<h3>Tag, you&#8217;re not it</h3>\n<p>One last thing was categorization and tags. Medium no longer allows regular users to put a post in any particular category, as far as I can tell. You have to be some sort of more-certified user or author to put a post in one of their channels or tags or whatever they call them.</p>\n<p>I thought this was a little frustrating. Without some kind of tag, how can I put my story in a feed that others that don&#8217;t already follow me can find? I think it has potential to prevent lesser-known writers from ever being exposed to more eyeballs, because there is a much smaller initial audience to read their post.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if I had 100 or 1,000 posts on Medium someday, it would make it harder for me to filter my own stuff. I often go back to certain categories on Post Status to see what I wrote about a particular topic in the past.</p>\n<h3>Notes and public previews</h3>\n<p>A couple of things that Medium excels at are notes and public previews. I can easily annotate my post in the margins, without putting the notes in the content (which I often do in WordPress). It&#8217;s very similar to Google Docs.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7373" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medium-notes-752x265.jpg" alt="medium-notes" width="752" height="265" /></p>\n<p>And public previews and draft sharing is exceptional. I have public preview functionality on Post Status, and it works okay; it&#8217;s built into Medium, and it has great placement and is easy to use.</p>\n<p>I think WordPress could build these features in. They simply make publishing better. Nearly every site could utilize a tool like this and I think that while there are plugin options for accomplishing these tasks, it&#8217;s pretty core to the experience and mission of publishing.</p>\n<h3>Plenty to gleam, but not a silver bullet</h3>\n<p>All in all, I liked publishing on Medium.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t own the content. Though they do have a one-click button for exporting everything you&#8217;ve ever written. (<em>edit: reader and former Medium employee Evan Solomon notes I do own the content itself. I guess I mean it more in the sense that I don&#8217;t own the platform, and can&#8217;t guarantee my content will always be there.</em>)</p>\n<p>I also can&#8217;t use my own domain. If I published there long term, that would be a problem.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unfair to compare Medium directly to WordPress. But from a publishing perspective, I&#8217;d say there are definitely elements WordPress could learn from. However, we shouldn&#8217;t just jump completely on the simplification bandwagon.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of who can definitely learn from Medium, it&#8217;s WordPress.com. If I were going with a hosted platform, owning my own domain and being able to choose my own theme are pretty much the only reasons I&#8217;d choose WordPress.com versus Medium. The overall account (especially) and publishing experiences (marginally) feel more polished on Medium than WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll publish on Medium again. Probably, when I find a circumstance that this blog or my personal blog aren&#8217;t the right place. It was fun to play with a shiny new tool, but I&#8217;m still a WordPress guy, and I think we&#8217;re doing alright.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 17:50:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: The WordPress Foundation Creates a Traveling Scholarship in Memory of Kim Parsell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37415";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:101:"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-creates-a-traveling-scholarship-in-memory-of-kim-parsell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3126:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsellDocsTeamMeetup.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37415]"><img class="size-full wp-image-36621" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsellDocsTeamMeetup.jpg?resize=750%2C460" alt="Kim Parsell With the Docs Team Meetup in Cincinnati 2013" /></a>Kim Parsell With the Docs Team Meetup in Cincinnati 2013\n<p><a title="http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away" href="http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away">Kim Parsell once told me</a> that attending WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was one of the best experiences of her life. It was her first WordCamp San Francisco and although she was unemployed at the time, she was able to attend thanks to financial assistance received from the <a title="http://wordpressfoundation.org/" href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a>. Knowing how much it meant to her to attend the event, the Foundation has launched a <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/">new scholarship program in memory of Kim </a>to provide women in the WordPress community the same opportunity.</p>\n<p>The details of the scholarship are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will be a scholarship for a woman contributor with financial need who has never attended the event before.</li>\n<li>It will be limited to WCSF’s replacement event rather than available for any WordCamp.</li>\n<li>When travel scholarships are announced for the event, this specific memorial scholarship will be mentioned in the post.</li>\n<li>It will cover the ticket cost, flight, and lodging.</li>\n<li>It will be awarded once per year.</li>\n<li>It will be funded by the Foundation.</li>\n<li>It will be awarded by the community team (or whoever within the project is overseeing travel scholarships that year) to the recipient 3 months in advance of the event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jen Mylo, who helped turn the idea into a reality, says the program will likely live inside of a broader scholarship program, &#8220;The assumption is that it will live within a broader travel scholarship program that can be worked on this year (SF was a test of the idea, but not intended to be the only WC that would offer assistance in the future if it worked well, which we haven’t yet worked out).&#8221;</p>\n<p>By limiting the scholarship to women, the goal is to encourage more women to get involved with the project.

Let&#8217;s start with the obvious: <strong>I&#8217;m not a lawyer or accountant and this post is just me chit chatting and doesn&#8217;t constitute any official form of advice or whatever other legal disclaimer you need, consider this it.</strong></p>\n<p>For most non-Europeans, the VAT may be unfamiliar, but it is relatively similar to an American sales tax. Until now, non-European businesses could basically ignore VAT (unless they have a European office), and Europeans were able to utilize the VAT rate of their home office. Now, that&#8217;s changing.</p>\n<p>Big companies from outside the EU, of course, found some nice loopholes to avoid high VAT rates even when they have a place of business in Europe; they did so by registering their EU operations in Luxembourg, where the VAT rate is lowest. Then, they only had to pay the Luxembourg rate, no matter who they sold to in the EU. <em>The EU is now changing the rules so that the VAT rate of the consumer&#8217;s purchasing location is the rate applied, no matter where the merchant is from</em>.</p>\n<h3>General VAT information</h3>\n<p>Getting easy to read information on VAT is hard. The purpose of this post is to provide that sort of information within the context of WordPress. However, for the best way to read VAT stuff in general, I&#8217;d recommend <a href="http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/2015-digital-services-moss/2015-digital-services-changes/">VAT Live</a>.</p>\n<h3>Impact on European businesses</h3>\n<p>This, in a nutshell, is the big deal. Previously, European merchants knew their own VAT rate and applied that rate to everyone they needed to apply it to. Now there are something like 28 different rates in the EU and merchants have to apply them based on the purchaser, not themselves.</p>\n<p>For EU merchants, this sucks. Starting two weeks ago, they now have to track a whole lot of stuff and (theoretically) pay taxes to all sorts of entities. The EU has organizations that help with this, and now there are businesses like <a href="http://www.taxamo.com/">Taxamo</a> that are helping handle the calculations and whatnot for these merchants.</p>\n<p>However, it appears actually complying is <a href="http://euvataction.org/2015/01/09/eu-vat-how-did-the-first-week-go-its-not-pretty/">hard for small businesses and large</a> so far. For Europeans, these rules are a complete mess and is truly going to screw up the digital good economy for European merchants.</p>\n<h3>Impact on non-European businesses</h3>\n<p>For non-European businesses, the new VAT rules are a lot fuzzier.</p>\n<p>In short, nothing has changed. There have been European rules in place since 2003 saying that non-European merchants should pay VAT when selling to European consumers &#8212; even for digital goods. The thing is: <em>they didn&#8217;t enforce this because non-Europeans obviously aren&#8217;t under jurisdiction of European authorities</em>.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">So, most merchants not in Europe &#8212; but selling to Europeans &#8212; have ignored existing rules for years, and we still can. But there is a but.</span> According to some places I&#8217;m reading, there is the potential that American and other non-European governments could cooperate and even enforce European VAT rules on its citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this likely? </strong>Heck if I know. I honestly can&#8217;t decide if companies like Taxamo are just trying to churn up fear to get more customers (which is natural) or if Americans and other non-Europeans should really pay attention to VAT.</p>\n<p>My gut tells me this policy is terrible and won&#8217;t last, at least without some kind of revenue floor (like 1 million Euros or the equivalent per year, or something). But that change could be years in the making. What until then?</p>\n<h3>The determining factors and implications</h3>\n<p>In the end, it really depends on how willing you are to roll the dice. In my heart of hearts, I hate the idea of paying a foreign government tax revenue for a digitial good when they have no jurisdiction over me.</p>\n<p>Even &#8220;digital good&#8221; is hard to define, though the UK attempts to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-brief-46-2014-vat-rule-change-and-the-vat-mini-one-stop-shop-additional-guidance/revenue-and-customs-brief-46-2014-vat-rule-change-and-the-vat-mini-one-stop-shop-additional-guidance#section-2">define qualified services in this document</a>.</p>\n<p>I mean, I don&#8217;t even have to charge sales tax to other states in the US when Americans buy from me. Ugh. So, I really, really want to just ignore the EU &#8212; as an American at least &#8212; and tell them to screw off and catch me if they can.</p>\n<p>But.</p>\n<p>There are a few buts this time.</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> It is risky. Because it is possible that the IRS will collaborate with EU member states to collect tax revenue from American digital merchants, as companies like Taxamo suggest can/will happen. I don&#8217;t want to get hit with some kind of audit or fine from the IRS years down the road.</p>\n<p>A friend did make a good point to me recently, noting that the IRS barely enforces digital goods taxes in the United States, so why would they do so on behalf of a foreign entity?</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Are European buyers breaking the law if I don&#8217;t comply as a seller? I don&#8217;t know, but a friend of mine that is complying brought that up. I can&#8217;t find much documentation on this front, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to cause European customers to break their laws by buying from me if I don&#8217;t comply.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> It makes my product more expensive to European buyers if I comply, and it hurts my feelings as an American (Boston tea party, man!), but realistically, services will &#8212; and already are &#8212; come to save the EU with relatively simple ways to comply.</p>\n<h3>Enforcement and methods for complying</h3>\n<p>From what I can tell, each EU member state has to do its own collecting and enforcing. The EU is the regulating body but not the ones that will put feet on pavement to go and enforce these rules and taxes.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">The safe bet seems to be to pay up and deal with it.</span> But I have a feeling you could ignore these rules (if you aren&#8217;t European) and probably get by just fine.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, non-EU merchants could just ignore the EU and don&#8217;t sell to anyone there. Well, I won&#8217;t do that. I have a lot of EU-based readers and (potentially) customers. But I am pissed about these rules; <em>the European Union is hurting small businesses</em>, and the worldwide economy.</p>\n<p>I feel even worse for my EU-based friends. They don&#8217;t even have the option of ignoring EU member states. Penalties for non-compliance for them are even more frightening. They are being excluded as consumers of internationally distributed digital goods and also being pinned down as merchants by these overly cumbersome and irresponsibly drafted rules.</p>\n<h3>Self hosting eCommerce is even harder now</h3>\n<p>One additional implication of all of this is this: it is now even harder to self-host your eCommerce. If you sell at a marketplace like Etsy or ThemeForest, they can better (at least attempt to) manage the VAT rules and keep you safe. Though, from what I&#8217;ve heard, even some big marketplaces are struggling big-time with these new regulations.</p>\n<p>If you sell on your own, you have to figure out new methods on your own or with your software of choice.</p>\n<h3>How to comply with VAT</h3>\n<p>Complying with VAT has turned into a business opportunity, and &#8220;solutions&#8221; are popping up.</p>\n<p>No matter which solution you use, you&#8217;ll need to learn about <a href="http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/2015-digital-services-moss/mini-one-stop-shop-moss/">VATMOSS</a>. VATMOSS stands for Value-Added Tax Mini One Stop Shop. Basically, you can register with one EU country and thereafter just deal with that country for quarterly &#8220;returns&#8221; or payments.</p>\n<p>If you go through the UK, they have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-and-use-the-vat-mini-one-stop-shop">information on registering for VATMOSS</a>.</p>\n<p>The EU member countries will divvy up the differences in taxes collected on their own.</p>\n<p>For non-EU providers, <a href="http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/2015-digital-services-moss/non-eu-providers-vat-e-services-voes/">VoES</a> (VAT on Electronic Services) is also worth learning about if you&#8217;re providing &#8220;digital services.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>General needs</h3>\n<p>There are some general needs for your store if you&#8217;re going to comply with VAT</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know <a href="http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/2015-digital-services-moss/2015-digital-services-changes/">if your style of eCommerce applies</a></li>\n<li>You need to know the country of origin for the buyer</li>\n<li>You need the buyer&#8217;s IP address</li>\n<li>You need the country of origin for the buyer&#8217;s credit card</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honestly, some WordPress plugins are playing catchup to make these things possible and / or easier.</p>\n<p>In addition to information collection, information storage is also important. You&#8217;re supposed to store this stuff for up to ten years! You are also supposed to have ready-made reports for various authorities.</p>\n<p>Some services are helping with the calculations, others with the whole gambit.</p>\n<h4>Taxamo</h4>\n<p>The number one player I&#8217;ve seen in the VAT compliance market is <a href="http://www.taxamo.com/">Taxamo</a>. They are working hard to market their product, which identifies the consumer&#8217;s country, applies the appropriate VAT, integrates with your eCommerce application, stores and creates reports of your data, and fills out a quarterly return form on your behalf. They do so for 0.20 Euros per transaction, once you surpass 20 transactions per month.</p>\n<p>Taxamo is trying to handle pretty much every part of the handshake for you, from collecting to reporting. Here&#8217;s their flow:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7350" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/taxamo-752x416.jpg" alt="taxamo" width="752" height="416" /></p>\n<p>Taxamo has a few integrations:</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rcp-taxamo/">Taxamo for Restrict Content Pro</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/taxamo-integration/">Taxamo for Easy Digital Downloads</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-taxamo/">Taxamo for WooCommerce</a></p>\n<p>EU VAT API</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://vatinfo.eu/">EU VAT API</a> is more hands-on, but probably a nice option for developers looking for a minimilist solution. Developed by Radish Concepts (savvy readers may recognize WordPress community member Coen Jacobs, who works with Radish), the EU VAT API is a simple, but seemingly elegant solution for the calculation of the various EU VAT rates.</p>\n<p>The EU VAT API has WordPress integration plugins for both <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-vatinfoeu/">WooCommerce</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/edd-vatinfoeu/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>\n<p><em>edit: Coen Jacobs tells me that like Taxamo, the EU VAT API also handles more than just rates, but they haven&#8217;t fully documented all of the other features yet.</em></p>\n<h4>Other methods</h4>\n<p>The <a href="https://vatapi.com/">VAT API</a> is another simple API that looks good, but I don&#8217;t know as much about it.</p>\n<h3>Compliance with specific eCommerce systems</h3>\n<p>The big WordPress eCommerce players pretty much all have VAT compliance methods in place by now:</p>\n<p>WooCommerce &#8211; they&#8217;re heavily on the Taxamo bandwagon, and have <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-taxamo/">this extension</a>. But there&#8217;s also the <a href="https://github.com/radishconcepts/woocommerce-vatinfoeu">Radish Concepts one</a> noted earlier.They also have a <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/eu-vat-number/">super slim extension</a> where customers can enter an EU VAT number, that uses an API to calculate the cost. There&#8217;s a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-assistant/">free plugin on WordPress.org</a> too. Also, <a href="http://develop.woothemes.com/woocommerce/2014/11/attention-theme-authors-frontend-changes-ahead-in-woocommerce-2-3/">WooCommerce 2.3 is beefing up some features</a> that will make it better capable for handling some of the more nuanced VAT rules.</p>\n<p>Easy Digital Downloads &#8211; Has a lot of options. Here&#8217;s their <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions?extension_s=VAT&action=extension_search">site tag for &#8220;VAT&#8221; that lists the options</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://getshopped.org">WP E-Commerce</a> &#8211; Has one coming, but it&#8217;s not complete yet.</p>\n<p><a href="http://jigoshop.com">Jigoshop</a> &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any references to the new VAT rules, but since these guys are based in Europe, surely they either have something or are working on it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ithemes.com/2014/12/30/ithemes-exchange-vat-add-updated-ready-vat-moss/">iThemes Exchange</a> &#8211; Has what appears to be an in-house VAT add-on, up to date for 2015.</p>\n<h3>Who is complying so far?</h3>\n<p>I was interested in who is actually complying with the new VAT rules so far &#8212; both Europeans and non-Europeans.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve received 120 votes from shop owners selling digital goods in my poll. I think that&#8217;s a pretty great response. Here are the results:</p>\n<p><strong>Question: Do you have an eCommerce store that sells digital goods? Are you complying with the new EU VAT rules?</strong></p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7351" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VAT-poll-compliance-752x322.jpg" alt="VAT-poll-compliance" width="752" height="322" /></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Count</th>\n<th>%</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>I&#8217;m a European merchant and complying with new VAT rules</td>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>22.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I&#8217;m a European merchant and not yet complying with new VAT rules</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>16.67%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I&#8217;m a non-European merchant and complying with new VAT rules for European customers</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I&#8217;m a non-European merchant and not complying with new VAT rules for European customers</td>\n<td>31</td>\n<td>25.83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I&#8217;m a non-European merchant and I no longer sell to European customers</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I haven&#8217;t decided what to do yet</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9.17%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other:</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>8.33%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I guess the numbers aren&#8217;t terribly surprising, though I am quite surprised by how many Europeans are not complying.</p>\n<h3>Now what?</h3>\n<p>I think most of us will agree that these rules suck. The most organized thing I&#8217;ve seen to protest them is the <a href="http://euvataction.org/">EU VAT Action site</a>. You should go there and see how to petition and participate in the debate if you are upset by these changes.</p>\n<p>Quite personally, I have to figure out what to do. My primary reasoning for doing this research was to decide if I need to comply. I wanted to share what I&#8217;ve learned with you.</p>\n<p>In addition to the poll I did, I also asked some friends running businesses. I think you&#8217;d be surprised just how many &#8220;big&#8221; American companies aren&#8217;t complying (big in the sense of the WordPress space).</p>\n<p>It does keep coming back to me, what one friend told me about how easy it was to register for VATMOSS and get his shop setup though. I guess I have a few more days to decide.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t figured out what you&#8217;re going to do with your shop yet, I hope this has helped. If you plan to sell some digital goods in the future, this should be a decent guide to get the lay of the land in terms of selling digital goods with WordPress and complying with the new European VAT rules.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 21:52:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: Venture Capital in the 80s";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44595";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://ma.tt/2015/01/venture-capital-in-the-80s/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:198:"<p>For the best explanation of what&#8217;s going on with capital markets now <a href="http://reactionwheel.net/2015/01/80s-vc.html">it might be best to look to Venture Capital in the 1980s</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 18:30:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: Papi Project Adds a Page Type API to WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37377";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wptavern.com/papi-project-adds-a-page-type-api-to-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4177:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pages.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37377]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pages.jpg?resize=1024%2C498" alt="photo credit: zenobia_joy - cc" class="size-full wp-image-37381" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/zenobia_joy/5509949256/">zenobia_joy</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages" target="_blank">Pages</a> feature, although generated dynamically in WordPress, was designed for use with static, evergreen content. Pages have always been somewhat simpler than posts, which received a major boost to flexibility when custom <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types" target="_blank">post types</a> came on the scene in version 3.0.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/frozzare" target="_blank">Fredrik Forsmo</a>, a systems developer in Stockholm, Sweden, wanted to do more with pages and decided that WordPress needs a Page Type API. He created <a href="https://wp-papi.github.io/" target="_blank">Papi</a>, an open source project that offers a less traditional approach to working with fields and page types.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Papi was started because creating page types didn&#8217;t exists in a good way,&#8221; Forsmo said. &#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/" target="_blank">ACF</a> and other plugins only support custom fields on different post types. This is not a good way to create page types. Additionally, the URL structure isn&#8217;t ideal with custom post types.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Inspired by the lack of adequate solutions to address this need, Forsmo spent a year developing Papi in his spare time. The idea for the project is based on EPiServer&#8217;s <a href="http://pagetypebuilder.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Page Type Builder</a>, which offers a more object oriented method of building pages. Papi brings this same approach to WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/add-new-page-type-view.png" rel="prettyphoto[37377]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/add-new-page-type-view.png?resize=1025%2C448" alt="add-new-page-type-view" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37397" /></a></p>\n<p>Essentially, it allows you to create page types using an existing post type or using custom post types. It doesn&#8217;t have an admin user interface for adding all the fields. &#8220;Papi uses classes in PHP, where one class represents one page type and in your class you add all fields you need,&#8221; Forsmo explained.</p>\n<p>After running it in production, he discovered that it&#8217;s easy to work with when it&#8217;s necessary to add new fields. Using Papi&#8217;s &#8220;page&#8221; post type, you can create different page types with different fields on the same post type, while maintaining a clean URL structure.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/start-page-example-page.png" rel="prettyphoto[37377]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/start-page-example-page.png?resize=1025%2C594" alt="start-page-example-page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37401" /></a></p>\n<p>Forsmo believes that this is the way pages should work in WordPress. Although I don&#8217;t know if the idea will catch on with developers, the project seems useful for those rare scenarios where custom post types aren&#8217;t a good match.</p>\n<p>Papi isn&#8217;t on the WordPress plugin directory but can be downloaded from <a href="https://wp-papi.github.io/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s also available as a <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-papi/papi" target="_blank">Composer package</a>. Papi currently works on WordPress 3.8+ (3.9+ if on HHVM) and PHP 5.3 and above. If you want to experiment with it, Forsmo has written <a href="http://papi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">documentation</a> on how to get started, how to add page type meta boxes and options, functions available to use in your page type, and how to register a page type directory.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 16:28:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: Edit BuddyPress Activity Posts on the Front End";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37251";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://wptavern.com/edit-buddypress-activity-posts-on-the-front-end";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3849:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/buddypress-edit-activity.png" rel="prettyphoto[37251]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/buddypress-edit-activity.png?resize=1025%2C465" alt="buddypress-edit-activity" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37345" /></a></p>\n<p>Earlier this week, the folks at <a href="http://www.buddyboss.com/" target="_blank">BuddyBoss</a> released <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-buddypress-global-search-plugin-adds-unified-search-of-all-buddypress-components" target="_blank">BuddyPress Global Search</a>, a new plugin that allows users to search through every BuddyPress component.

This plugin is another handy tool that is likely to be useful for a wide range of social networks. It allows users to edit their activity posts and replies on the front end, similar to the &#8220;Edit Post&#8221; feature that you see available on Facebook.</p>\n<p>Once installed, you&#8217;ll find a new edit option added the activity meta buttons.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/buddypress-activity-edit-button.png" rel="prettyphoto[37251]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/buddypress-activity-edit-button.png?resize=1025%2C351" alt="buddypress-activity-edit-button" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37348" /></a></p>\n<p>Clicking the button allows users to edit their own activity updates and replies.

The panel also has an option to disable editing after a set number of minutes, a feature often available in plugins that extend WordPress comments. Setting it to zero makes comments editable indefinitely.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bp-activity-fronted-edit-settings.png" rel="prettyphoto[37251]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bp-activity-fronted-edit-settings.png?resize=1025%2C524" alt="bp-activity-fronted-edit-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37362" /></a></p>\n<p>I tested the plugin and found that it works well and fits in like a natural part of BuddyPress. It automatically adapts to your current active theme and doesn&#8217;t force any obtrusive styles on the activity stream.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-edit-activity/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Edit Activity</a> may seem like a small thing but it&#8217;s one of those extensions that adds an intuitive feature that greatly improves interaction between users. This is a feature that users have grown to expect based on experience with other social networks.</p>\n<p>BuddyBoss is hitting home runs with its most recent plugin releases, both of which are useful for nearly any type of BuddyPress network.

It is GPL-licensed and meant to be used with any host.</p>\n<p>After provisioning your VM, Mercury Vagrant includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://percona.com/" target="_blank">Percona DB</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://php-fpm.org/" target="_blank">PHP-FPM</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://hhvm.com/" target="_blank">HHVM</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://nginx.com/" target="_blank">Nginx</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank">Varnish</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank">Memcached</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>HGV creates four different sites, with built-in documentation, for running code with either HHVM or PHP-FPM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://hgv.dev" target="_blank">hgv.dev</a> &#8212; General documentation and links for all of the tools</li>\n<li><a href="http://hhvm.hgv.dev" target="_blank">hhvm.hgv.dev</a> &#8212; A new WordPress installation running on HHVM</li>\n<li><a href="http://php.hgv.dev" target="_blank">php.hgv.dev</a> &#8212; A new WordPress installation running on PHP-FPM (PHP 5.5)</li>\n<li><a href="http://admin.hgv.dev" target="_blank">admin.hgv.dev</a> &#8212; Useful administrative tools (phpMyAdmin, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also includes URLs for testing Varnish caching:</p>\n<p><a href="http://admin.hgv.dev" target="_blank">cache.php.hgv.dev</a><br />\n<a href="http://cache.hhvm.hgv.dev" target="_blank">cache.hhvm.hgv.dev</a></p>\n<p>WP Engine labs is committed to supporting and improving Mercury Vagrant for the foreseeable future. The team has collaborated with Facebook to resolve many of the previous issues of using HHVM with WordPress sites. Even if you&#8217;re using different host that offers HHVM, this open source Vagrant configuration is a solid, professionally-supported tool for local testing. If you need help <a href="http://wpengine.com/mercury/how-to-start/" target="_blank">getting started</a>, WP Engine created a visual walk through and tutorial videos to help you set up your local machine with HHVM with Vagrant.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/wpengine/hgv" target="_blank">Mercury Vagrant</a> is a community tool that will go a long way towards helping developers become more familiar with running sites on HHVM. <a href="http://wpengine.com/mercury" target="_blank">Benchmarks comparing WordPress sites on HHVM vs PHP-FPM</a> indicate a 600% performance increase with HHVM. Dramatic performance increases in this range should have more hosts looking to add support for HHVM in the near future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 22:02:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: I Love Composer, I Love WordPress, But I Object to a Marriage";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37262";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wptavern.com/i-love-composer-i-love-wordpress-but-i-object-to-a-marriage";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10606:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/composer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37262]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/composer.jpg?resize=1024%2C509" alt="photo credit: Jesse Kruger - cc" class="size-full wp-image-37299" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessekruger/390534235/">Jesse Kruger</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a>\n<hr />\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/david-hayes.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[37262]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/david-hayes.jpg?resize=150%2C150" alt="david-hayes" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-37266" /></a><br />\nThis post was contributed by <a href="http://www.davidbhayes.com/" target="_blank">David Hayes</a>.

The <a href="http://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/" target="_blank">Roots theme framework</a> folks like it. There&#8217;s support infrastructure like <a href="http://wpackagist.org/" target="_blank">WPackagist</a>.</p>\n<p>Composer is widely known in the wider PHP development space. Developer types who mostly focus on WordPress probably have some passing familiarity with it. Maybe you ran across a project I mentioned, or heard about it at a WordCamp or meet-up. Or maybe you&#8217;ve seen Sarah&#8217;s intermittent coverage here at the Tavern when projects — most recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-will-add-support-for-composer" target="_blank">BuddyPress</a> — take steps to support it.</p>\n<p>Composer is awesome. I think it&#8217;s the most exciting thing to happen to PHP in the last five years. WordPress is awesome. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress for nearly a decade now, and I wouldn&#8217;t recommend people use anything else for a beautiful, feature-rich publishing experience for the web. But I don&#8217;t think the two fit together as well as some would like, and that&#8217;s our focus.</p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know what Composer is, we&#8217;ll start with that. Then we&#8217;ll cover a bit about why WordPress is great and explain where the two fit together, sometimes a bit awkwardly. Finally, we&#8217;ll look at how and when it makes sense to incorporate Composer into WordPress work.</p>\n<h3>What is Composer Anyway?</h3>\n<p>In the very simplest version, Composer is dependency management for PHP. That is, it&#8217;s the way that I can pull in external code — libraries, classes, whatever you want to call them — that other people wrote, make sure it&#8217;s loaded for me to use, and never need to worry about it again. Many other languages have had solutions to this problem for awhile, of varying quality. In Ruby, <a href="https://rubygems.org/" target="_blank">Gems</a> are very well known. For front-end JavaScript development, there&#8217;s some standardization on Bower. Python&#8217;s pip has been around awhile. All of these things have similar roles, but the specific implementation is different.</p>\n<p>The big problem dependency managers solve is the way most people deal with dependencies — other people&#8217;s code they&#8217;re using to solve a problem. Without a tool like Composer, it is sloppy and haphazard. When you want a user-friendly date handling library, you go to your search engine, find a few hundred lines of code, copy them into a file, try your best to figure out how to work with them, and never ever know or care when the author of those lines later realizes they created a giant performance bottleneck or security vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Dependency managers also take care of the issue that some code you want to use may itself rely on other libraries, classes, etc., that you aren&#8217;t already using. This leads to big headaches. And in solving these issues, Composer also makes sure that it gets versions of all that software that work for all the various libraries your application makes use of.</p>\n<p>So with Composer, you&#8217;re saved from a lot of copy-pasting, you get super-powers about dependency issues, and you&#8217;re also given a much easier path to get performance improvements, security patches, new features, and so on.</p>\n<p>So you can, for example, tell Composer you want to use a nice date parsing library like <a href="https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon" target="_blank">Carbon</a>, set your code up to load the Composer dependencies for you before you use them (with a simple include &#8216;vendor/autoload.php''; to use this article&#8217;s only snippet of PHP) and you&#8217;re set to go. And when Carbon, or another dependency, gets updated, you&#8217;ll be able to quickly get the latest version with a simple run of Composer&#8217;s update command.</p>\n<h3>What Makes WordPress Great</h3>\n<p>Since you&#8217;re reading WPTavern, I’ll just say, succinctly, that WordPress is an easy-to-use CMS with a rich ecosystem of plugins and themes that make it easy to accomplish a wide variety of goals.</p>\n<p>WordPress is made to be easy-to-use — specifically, for the end user. An average WordPress user, who is put a little on edge by the mention of PHP code, is still able to easily change the look or behavior of their site just by installing a new theme and a few of the thousands of great plugins out there, right from the simple user interface. Even for commercial plugins and themes, the user can probably rely on few-click updates. Users get security updates to their core WordPress code without even needing to think about it.</p>\n<h3>How Composer and WordPress Can Work Together</h3>\n<p>As Josh Pollock called out in <a href="http://torquemag.io/improving-wordpress-development-workflow-composer/" target="_blank">a great article about Composer</a>, there are three basic ways WordPress and Composer can be combined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To manage dependencies for a theme or a plugin you’re developing</li>\n<li>To manage your themes and plugins used on a site</li>\n<li>For total site dependency management</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;ll take on the last two first, as they&#8217;re the most common way in which people are talking about Composer.</p>\n<h3>Why Composer and WordPress Aren&#8217;t as Compatible as Peanut Butter and Jelly</h3>\n<p>So WordPress is great and easy to use for slightly-more-technical-than-average people. Composer is great — really really great — for developers. Don&#8217;t two great things make a new even greater thing? I mean: I love peanut butter, and I love jelly, and I think a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is one of the top ten foods invented in America. So why don&#8217;t I love the combination of Composer and WordPress?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re useless together. I think they can work together quite well, but I don&#8217;t think the solution of &#8220;run your whole WordPress site with Composer&#8221; that&#8217;s creeping into more and more places works well. It takes care of one problem — WordPress being awkward to manage and deploy for developer-types — by creating another — a less-than-great experience for the mortals left with the WordPress site who just want to install this new plugin.</p>\n<p>Basically, in trying to cram WordPress into Composer we’re forcing a square peg into a round hole. WordPress’ focus on end-user ease-of-use — just jump into the admin area and search for a plugin on the WordPress.org repository, or upload the Zip archive you got from the seller — is conceptually at odds with using Composer to install WordPress.</p>\n<p>The change of behavior, and frankly the greater knowledge required, makes it the opposite of a simple experience for most. For a site with dedicated and knowledgeable developers or admins around 24/7, that’s possibly a wise trade off, but for most WordPress sites I see, that’s a losing combination.</p>\n<h3>When Composer and WordPress are a Good Combination</h3>\n<p>Even for most WordPress cases, I think there&#8217;s one place where Composer&#8217;s great: when you have some dependencies in a theme or plugin. It&#8217;s the combination of WordPress and Composer I&#8217;ve tried repeatedly and recommend heartily. It is brilliant. When you&#8217;ve got a project that you know doesn&#8217;t really need to support down to PHP 5.2, and where you really do want some helper code, Composer is fantastic as a way to get that external code and seamlessly keep it up to date. (Autoloading, a Composer feature which we&#8217;ve ignored until this point, is also a big perk.)</p>\n<p>For plugin or theme development, I think Composer is great. If you&#8217;re making a plugin that would benefit from a great date-parsing library like Carbon, <a href="https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark" target="_blank">a Markdown parser</a>, or something else, by all means use Composer to pull that in. For more WordPress specific stuff, such as <a href="https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2" target="_blank">CMB2</a> or <a href="https://github.com/thomasgriffin/TGM-Plugin-Activation" target="_blank">TGM Plugin Activation</a>, it&#8217;s far better to pull that from Composer than an old-school copy and paste.</p>\n<h3>There&#8217;s a Time and a Place for Composer</h3>\n<p>WordPress and Composer aren’t useless together; far from it. But the &#8220;run your whole WordPress site with Composer&#8221; solution is only right for developer-intensive use of WordPress. If you&#8217;re using something like <a href="http://capistranorb.com/" target="_blank">Capistrano</a> for deployments already, go ahead and slot Composer right in beside it. For casual WordPress users, even those who&#8217;ve made or modified a theme or plugin before, Composer is most likely to end up feeling like awkward-to-integrate overkill.</p>\n<p>As a developer, you should know how to use Composer to take care of complex dependencies inside of a plugin or theme and then package up your Composer dependencies in a way that is invisible to the end user. Let them be blissfully unaware that you&#8217;ve used Composer at all. Let them keep that smooth and comfortable WordPress flow with core security and easy updates. That way we get the best of both!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 19:51:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: The Features as Plugins First Model Is a Mess";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=33335";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://wptavern.com/the-features-as-plugins-first-model-is-a-mess";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7987:"<p>Released in late 2013, <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-3-8-parker-released">WordPress 3.8</a> was packed with new features including, a new theme browser experience, widgets area chooser, and a redesign of the backend. It&#8217;s also the first release to include a feature using a new formal development process called <strong>features-as-plugins</strong> first. The backend redesign started off as a plugin called MP6 with <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/">development beginning</a> in March, 2013.</p>\n<p>Prior to MP6, features were largely developed inside of core during the development cycle. This method caused some versions to be delayed, as was <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-3-6-project-schedule/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-3-6-project-schedule/">the case for WordPress 3.6</a>. The success of MP6 proved that by developing core features as plugins first, they were easier to test, manage, and merge into core at the appropriate time. Since adopting the development process, at least seven features have <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">landed in core</a>. However, as an outsider looking in, the process seems to be falling apart.</p>\n<h2>MP6 Set The Bar</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mp6.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[33335]"><img class="size-full wp-image-10695" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mp6.jpg?resize=800%2C452" alt="MP6 WordPress Admin Plugin" /></a>MP6 WordPress Admin Plugin\n<p>Each week, Matt Mullenweg and Matt Thomas released a new version for people to test. They also kept <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/mp6/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/mp6/">everyone updated</a> on what changed and left the comment form open to solicit feedback. This made it easy for people to participate in the development and testing process. By using P2 and the comment section, it was a lot easier to provide feedback. Since MP6 was a plugin, testing it was as easy as installing it on a stable version of WordPress.</p>\n<h2>The Lack of a Testing Audience</h2>\n<p>MP6 was available for download on the WordPress plugin directory. This made it accessible to anyone who wanted to test it. Recent plugins like the <a title="https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-session-manager" href="https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-session-manager">User Session Manager</a> by John Blackbourn don&#8217;t have any P2 posts on the Make WordPress Core site. As with several other features, discussion took place within a <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30264" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30264">trac ticket</a>. Development of the plugin was handled on Github until it received a pass to be merged into core. Having a feature plugin only available on Github and a lack of communication surrounding the feature prevents a lot of people from potentially being part of the testing group.</p>\n<p>WordPress lead developer, Ryan Boren, <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/03/open-update-thread/#comment-20735" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/11/03/open-update-thread/#comment-20735">noted in an open thread</a> in November of 2014, that when it comes to gathering a testing audience, no feature plugin has reached the standards set by MP6. For plugins to be merged into core, Boren suggested the following items should be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be present and up-to-date in the plugin directory.</li>\n<li>Be as ready to go on mobile as they are on desktop.</li>\n<li>Have visual records for major flows through all new interfaces on all devices.</li>\n<li>Have mature UI that isn’t going to derail the release train.</li>\n<li>Have a history of posting weekly updates to make/core.</li>\n<li>Have a history of regular plugin directory updates.</li>\n<li>Have a testing audience.</li>\n<li>Publish a merge consideration post on make/core complete with visual records and other diligence.</li>\n<li>Exist for at least one release cycle. Plugins created at the beginning of a release cycle should not be considered for merge until the next release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several feature plugins fail to adhere to many of these proposed guidelines. In June of 2014, Andrew Nacin added a &#8220;<a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-trunk-adds-new-beta-testing-tab-to-plugins-screen" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-trunk-adds-new-beta-testing-tab-to-plugins-screen">Beta Testing</a>&#8221; tab to the add plugins screen for those who use WordPress trunk. The tab lists <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/" target="_blank">Feature Plugins</a> that are available for testing.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FeaturedPlugins.png" rel="prettyphoto[33335]"><img class="size-full wp-image-37253" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FeaturedPlugins.png?resize=1025%2C404" alt="Featured Plugin Development Looks Dead" /></a>Feature Plugin Development Looks Dead\n<p>Based on the results in the screenshot, it looks like every feature plugin is dead in the water, including the WP API. However, if you look at the activity for <a title="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API" href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API">WP API on Github</a>, there&#8217;s plenty of development taking place. How can more people participate in the testing process if feature plugins are not routinely updated and available for download in the directory? This needs to change sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h2>Feature Plugins are More Like Experiments</h2>\n<p>Feature plugins are not guaranteed to be added to WordPress. Instead, the process is similar to a lab with each one being an experiment. Sometimes a plugin won&#8217;t be added but parts of it will. For example, many of the improvements to the post editor in 3.9, 4.0, and 4.1 are derived from the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/">Front-end Editor</a>. Maybe the core team should think about renaming them to <strong>feature experiments</strong> as it&#8217;s more representative of what they really are.</p>\n<h2>Project Management</h2>\n<p>When I brought up the subject of feature plugin development at the January 7th core development meeting, Scott Taylor <a title="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1420669524004536" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1420669524004536">made an excellent point</a>, &#8220;F<span class="message_content">eatures-as-plugins often become Projects without requirements or tasks, which leads to a non-schedule, and then often require all-or-nothing to go in.&#8221; Feature plugins are generally driven by one or two people who might be good developers, but lack project management skills. It&#8217;s almost like someone needs to constantly shepherd feature plugins to make sure they&#8217;re following a schedule and keeping them all on the same page.</span></p>\n<h2>The Process Needs to be Fixed</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that the feature plugin development process is disjointed at best.

Just one week after launch, <a href="http://justintadlock.com/" target="_blank">Justin Tadlock</a>, a fellow member of the WordPress.org theme review team and author of the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core" target="_blank">Hybrid Core</a> framework, is joining forces with Uzelac to provide professional reviews to customers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m interested in seeing where this goes. We (DevPress when I was there) were going to offer this service. It never took off because the business itself didn’t,&#8221; Tadlock <a href="http://wptavern.com/emil-uzelac-launches-new-wordpress-theme-review-service#comment-62455" target="_blank">commented</a> on the original announcement. In the past he has conducted paid reviews privately for commercial theme vendors. Uzelac noticed his interest and pounced on the opportunity to partner with him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To quote one of my all time favorite businessman, J.C. Penney: &#8216;Growth is never by mere chance; it is the result of forces working together,''&#8221; Uzelac said. &#8220;Justin and I exchanged a few ideas in my launching interview and that is where I learned from Jeff that he had this idea back in 2011.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since this idea has been on Tadlock&#8217;s mind for several years, he didn&#8217;t hesitate to get involved. &#8220;It&#8217;s something I pretty much immediately hopped on.  We already have a bit of a working relationship as admins for the Theme Review Team.  I believe it&#8217;s a good fit,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Based on his <a href="http://wptavern.com/justin-tadlock-publishes-the-results-of-his-themeforest-experiment" target="_blank">experience at ThemeForest</a> and his service on the WordPress.org Theme Review Team, Tadlock is convinced that developers of all experience levels can benefit from professional theme review:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Professional theme authors who want to bring the highest quality theme to market need assurance that their code is solid. There&#8217;s nothing worse than spending months building an awesome theme only to have it break for a bunch of users because you missed something minor.  Even the most experienced theme authors (myself included) overlook problems that a fresh, second pair of eyes could easily find.  We have editors for books, newspapers, and so on for the same reason.  Authors, whether they&#8217;re writers or theme developers, are going to miss something.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although themes have always been critical to the success of WordPress, theme review is just now emerging as a service for which one might want to hire a dedicated professional. Tadlock attributes this to the increasing complexity of theme development. &#8220;Themes are a lot more complex than they were just 5 years ago, for example.  This isn&#8217;t just because theme authors are packing in more stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of it is because basic WordPress theme development has gotten more complex. WordPress has been packing in a lot of new things in recent years, and themes need to account for a variety of possibilities. Just having someone running through unit tests will be a big help.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several readers commented on the original announcement to suggest that Uzelac consider offering a certification or badge of some sort for commercial theme authors to display once their themes have passed a professional review. Tadlock is open to the idea but sees it more as a marketing tool for their customers to employ.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s probably a good idea, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what really matters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think the focus should be on giving our clients (theme devs) peace of mind.  Once we are seen as a legit and well-known service, a badge or something will most likely become a useful marketing tool for theme authors.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://themereview.co/" target="_blank">The Theme Review service</a> has already gained traction, and Uzelac reports that he completed his fourth review today. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken only what I could handle alone and in time. Now that Justin is in, we will do more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In only few days after the initial launch the response and support has been overwhelming. This confirms that our community is in great need of experienced reviewers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When it comes to WordPress theme review skills and experience, Uzelac and Tadlock&#8217;s forces combined are unparalleled in the WordPress community. Tadlock hopes that together they can expand their efforts to serve more commercial theme providers. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see regular business from some of the major theme shops,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably the biggest goal I&#8217;d shoot for at the moment.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 23:41:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"WPTavern: VersionPress RC1 Released to Early Backers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=37215";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-rc1-released-to-early-backers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3708:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[37215]"><img class="size-full wp-image-24643" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/VersionPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200" alt="Version Control Featured Image" /></a>Version Control Featured Image\n<p><a title="http://versionpress.net/" href="http://versionpress.net/">VersionPress</a>, the plugin that allows you to <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses">revert changes to a site</a> without having to restore a backup, is <a title="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/01/announcing-early-access-program/" href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/01/announcing-early-access-program/">being released</a> to early backers. Near the middle of 2014, VersionPress creators <a href="https://twitter.com/borekb">Borek Bernard</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JanVoracek">Jan Voráček</a> created a crowdfunding campaign asking for $30K.</p>\n<p>The campaign started off on a rocky note, as several readers <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-adopts-the-gpl-software-license" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-adopts-the-gpl-software-license">questioned what license</a> the plugin would use. Bernard decided to license the plugin using the GPLv2, but the decision was made near the middle of the campaign and the duo missed their goal by $14.5K. However, development continued and, for the past several months, the team has been hard at work getting the product to a point where people can start using it.</p>\n<p>A release candidate will be made available later this week to those who backed the project with $50 or more. If no major issues are reported, the team will release version 1.0 by the end of the month. However, the plugin will not be free to use. Those who want access to version 1.0 and future releases will need to join the <a title="http://versionpress.net/#get" href="http://versionpress.net/#get">early access program</a>. The program tries to strike a balance between making the plugin accessible to anyone who&#8217;s interested and funding development.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VersionPressEarlyAccessProgramPrices.png" rel="prettyphoto[37215]"><img class="size-full wp-image-37221" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VersionPressEarlyAccessProgramPrices.png?resize=956%2C308" alt="VersionPress Early Access Program Prices" /></a>Early Access Program Prices\n<p>VersionPress 1.0 is an initial release and won&#8217;t have all of the planned features such as sync and staging. Instead, those features will be rolled out in future versions of the product. According to their development plan:</p>\n<ul type="disc">\n<li>Version <strong>1.0</strong> will contain all the important <strong>basics</strong> – things like <strong>Undo</strong>, <strong>Rollback</strong>, <strong>automatic change tracking</strong>, support for all the built-in WordPress types, etc.</li>\n<li>Version <strong>2.0</strong> will bring full support for <strong>sync and staging</strong>.</li>\n<li>Versions <strong>3.0</strong>, <strong>4.0</strong> etc. will bring features from the <a href="http://docs.versionpress.net/en/release-notes/roadmap">roadmap</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to see the duo remain committed to their goal of developing and shipping a working product. I still think VersionPress is a great idea and can&#8217;t wait to see how easy or difficult it is to use.

I''m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin'' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>\n\n...or something like this:\n\n<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>\n\nAs a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http://localhost/wordpressAppointmentPlugin/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content.
